You've got a buildpath problem, let see if we can solve it.

-First check you're settings. Goto:
Window->Preferences->Java->Build path->Classpath variables

-Check if there's an entry named JAVA_USER_LIBRARIES. If it isn't there create one by pressing the 'new' button.
For the name specify JAVA_USER_LIBRARIES, for the folder choose a folder on your disk.

-Once you have the entry in this list, you should check if all the required libraries are available so browse to the folder you specified.

	- If it's empty you can pickup your starter pack here: dep01-server02.fbk.eur.nl:8100/jasper/libs.zip
	- If it already has some content you need to check if the directory structure of the folder matches that of library entries in your project (Right click on your project->Build path->Configure Build path).
	
- That should get you started, if not mail/msn jaspervoskuilen at hotmail dot com

If you require additional libraries you can add them by downloading the required libraries, making additional folders in the the folder specified by the JAVA_USER_LIBRARIES variable. Let's say that the root folder has the libraryname with a subfolder with the versionname and in the version subfolder the actual libraries etc.
The next step is then to modify the project's build path.
Right click on your project->Build path->Configure Build path
Press 'add variable' select 'JAVA_USER_LIBRARIES' press 'extend' and select the jars
