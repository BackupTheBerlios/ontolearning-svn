Abstract:  The paper analyzes one of the most common life insurance products - the so-called
  participating (or with profits) policy. This type of contract stand in contrast to Unit-Linked    
  (UL) products in that interest is credited to the policy periodically according to some
  mechanism which smoothes past returns on the life insurance company's (LIC) assets. As is
  the case for ULL products, the participating policies are typically equipped with an interest
  rate guarantee and possibly also an option to surrender (sell-back) the policy to the LAC
  before maturity. The paper shows that the typical participating policy can be decomposed into
  a risk free bond element, a bonus option, and a surrender option. A dynamic model is
  constructed in which these elements can be valued separately using contingent claims analysis.
  the impact of various bonus policies and various levels of the guaranteed interest rate is
  analyzed numerically. we find that values of participating policies are highly sensitive to the
  bonus policy, that surrender options can be quite valuable, and that LAC solvency can be
  quickly jeopardised if earning opportunities deteriorate in a situation where bonus reserves are
  low and promised returns are high.

Abstract:  Industrial consumers' use of single, dual or multiple sourcing strategies indicate, 
   for example, how loyal they are towards their suppliers and whether they are transaction-oriented
   or relationship-oriented. in consequence, information about buyers' sourcing strategies is useful
   for sellers when evaluating and targeting different customer segments. This paper starts by 
   reviewing the literature on single, dual, and multiple sourcing. It then goes on to investigate 
   possible relationships between European corporate customers' sourcing strategies with regard to 
   their domestic cash management banks in 1996 and 1998, and their intentions to increase or decrease 
   the number of banks they use. It then goes on to examine their sourcing strategies by their
   geographical location, company size, industry type and market coverage. A questionnaire completed
   by more than 1000 corporate customers in 1996 and 1998 reveals that in most European countries the
   number of companies using three or more banks has decreased. Futher, it indicates that the single 
   sourcing segment is large in Austria, Ireland, and Norway. The segment relying on dual sourcing 
   is large in the Scandinavian countries, whereas the segment using three or more banks is the largest
   in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. No strong significant relationship is found between
   the descriptors of sourcing segments and company size, indutry type,and market coverage, but the
   results show a widespread intention of reducing the number of banks used. Finally, the 
   implications of these results are discussed.

Abstract:  Increasing competition and demanding customers in the financial retail sector has become a
  challenge to the sector's traditional management accounting systems. Few financial institutions
  have accounting systems that allow them to identify the profitability of customer segments,
  and the relationship between customer related activities, customer loyalty and profit are hardly
  known at all. However, information systems are changing. This article documents how Danish
  financial institutions  have accomplished - or planned - analyses of customer profitability.
  Other initiatives seem to support the customer orientation through empowerment at the
  branch level, but several barriers hamper further customer-oriented change in organizational
  behaviour. Data gathered at the branch level most strongly indicate problems of ownership and
  project sponsoring and it is argued that new accounting systems may be less important than
  goal-oriented participation of the frontline employees.

Abstract:We consider as given an arbitrage free interest rate model M, and a parametrized
    family of forward rate curves G. We study the question as to when the given family G is
    consistent with the dynamics of the interest rate model M, in the sense that M actually
    will produce forward rate curves belonging to G. We allow the interest rate model to be
    driven by a multidimensional Wiener process, as well as by a marked point process,
    and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency. As test cases, we study
    some popular models, obtaining both positive and negative results about consistency.
    We also introduce a natural exponential-polynomial family of forward rate curves, and
    for this family we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of consistent
    interest rate models with deterministic volatility functions.

Abstract: A new simulation methodology for the empirical analysis of financial market data 
   is introduced. The notion of an equivalent martingale measure is central to the approach.
   Contingent claims are priced without reference to the mean return or drift parameter.
   This implies that the simulator in the estimation procedure may be constructed under 
   the equivalent martingale measure and simulation therefore takes place without specifying
   drift. The simulation is for conditional moments as opposed to unconditional, and the inference
   procedure is robust to general forms of measurement errors, serial dependencies and other
   econometric problems. A numerical illustration in the context of stock index options is offered.

Abstract:Some analysts believe that the Internet will rapidly and fundamentally change the delivery
  channels, the company-consumer interactions, and the competition in many service industries. 
  Retail banking is one of these service industries. Others believe that this development will 
  be slow and that traditional bank branches and face-to-face communication continue to be the 
  most important factors in retail banking. This paper examines various aspects of the motives, 
  perceptions and expectations connected with the introduction of internet banking in Danish 
  retail banking. Responses from 60 key managers in the largest retail banks in Denmark show that 
  they believe that internet banking will become more important in the future, whereas all other 
  distribution channels are predicted to become less important. The paper further describes the 
  relationship between the perceptions of and expectations towards internet banking, the reasons 
  for offering an internet bank and the way it has been organized in the banks.

Abstract:	Videnregnskabet er et af de nye ledelseskoncepter, som i de seneste par år har 
   fået stor opmærksomhed. I denne artikel beskrives kortfattet, hvad et videnregnskab er, hvad 
   det kan indeholde og hvad det kan bruges til. En række virksomheder har offentliggjort 
   rapporter, der kan betegnes som videnregnskaber, men videnregnskabets karakter vil blive 
   meget mere klart i de kommende år, fordi adskillige danske virksomheder i øjeblikket er i gang 
   med at udvikle en ny generation af videnregnskaber.

Abstract: This paper explores why some retail banks are more vigorously promoting and have been 
   more successful in changing their distribution channel structure by introducing new electronic 
   channels, such as PC banking and internet banking, than other banks. Ten hypotheses are 
   formulated relating a number of variables to the banks' promotion and successful introduction 
   of the electronic channels. Responses from 60 key managers in the largest retail banks in 
   Denmark indicate that bank size, advantages for the customers and the banks, attention to the 
   future, senior management support, and willingness to cannibalize existing channels may be 
   important factors in explaining the successful introduction of the electronic channels. 
   Further, the results indicate that different attitudes and perceptions are related to different 
   means of attracting customers to the electronic channels. Finally the paper discusses the 
   implications for the banks and other firms of adopting the Internet as a distribution channel.
