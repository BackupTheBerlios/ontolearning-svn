Abstract: Progressive taxation is known to provide incentives for wage restraint and
 thereby lead to a higher level of employment in various models of equilibrium
 unemployment based on imperfectively competitive labour markets. It is shown in an
 efficiency wage model that although an increase in tax progression holding the average
 tax unchanged leads to a higher level of employment in the short run, once the full
 budgetary effects of changing tax progression is taken into account and free entry and exit
 of firms is allowed for in the long run, increasing tax progression leads to the opposite
 result, viz. a lower level of equilibrium employment.

Abstract: From an international perspective, the European rate of unemployment has been 
 relatively high and growing over the last one to two decades; on this background, the 
 parallel rise in profit shares in a number of European countries seems to be at odds with 
 expected economic behaviour. The paper contributes to a dissolution of this apparent enigma 
 in two steps. First, an empirical decomposition for two sub periods (1966-1981 and 1981-1996)
 suggests that the rise in profit shares during the second sub-period primarily originated 
 from three sources: a marked fall in real capital prices, a clear upward shift of the return
 to capital as a result of wage moderation, and a slowdown in the rate of growth of the 
 capital/labour ratio, compared with the first sub-period. Second, based on various estimates 
 of elasticities of substitution, this slowdown is analysed in greater depth. It turns out 
 that the adjustment of firms to growing profits and falling user cost of capital compared 
 with wages is sub-optimal. In the short run they do not substitute capital for labour in full
 accordance with cost minimising prescriptions and the speed of convergence towards a complete
 substitution is low. Hence, during this transitional period, investment - and thus labour 
 productivity - has been lower than would follow from rational behaviour.

Abstract: This paper introduces a representation of an integrated vector time series in which
 the coefficient of multiple correlation computed from the long-run covariance matrix of the
 innovation sequences is a primitive parameter of the model. Based on this representation, a
 notion of near cointegration is proposed and three separate applications of the model of near
 cointegration are provided. As a first application, we give analytical corroboration of the
 conjecture that the finite sample behavior of F-statistics based on OLS estimators depends
 continuously on the aforementioned squared multiple correlation coefficient. Hence, the 
 notion of near cointegration helps to bridge the gap between the polar cases of spurious
 regression and cointegration. Secondly, we characterize the properties of conventional
 cointegration methods under near cointegration, hereby investigating the robustness of
 cointegration methods. Finally, we illustrate how to obtain local power functions of
 cointegration tests that take cointegration as the null hypothesis.

Title: Specifying Nonlinear Econometric Models by Flexible Regression Models and

Abstract: The paper considers the task of selecting a flexible nonlinear model which can 
 be used as a baseline model. The baseline model may be used as a testing ground for  
 more structural models which are congruent with economic theory. From the limited  
 empirical evidence obtained here it is tentatively suggested to find a baseline nonlinear 
 flexible form for a univariate time series by following the procedure: 1. Recursively,  
 based on h extra periods at a time specify and estimate a linear form by use of model  
 selection criteria like Cross Validation and/or BIC. 2. After a preliminary test for  
 linearity, recursively, specify and estimate flexible regression models like the FNL  
 suggested by Hamilton (1999) and the Projection Pursuit model suggested by Aldrin,  
 Boelviken and Schweder (1993) for cases of moderate nonlinearities. Use the Cross    
 Validation and the BIC criteria. 3. Based on the remaining part of the data set select the 
 best nonlinear flexible form by use of forecast criteria measuring the absolute forecast  
 performance and the directional forecast performance in h-steps ahead predictions, and 
 compare the best flexible form to the linear specification by use of the Diebold Mariano 
 tests, see Deibold and Mariano (1995) and the forecast encompassing tests suggested by 
 Harvey, Lebourne, and Newhold (1998). The results indicate that the FNL method and 
 the Projection Pursuit Model are the preferable models to apply and that the CV and BIC 
 are the best selection criteria, while the forecast encompassing tests properly modified  
 as suggested by Harvey et. al. (1998) possess better power properties than the Diebold- 
 Mariano test.

Abstract: In this paper we examine a representative agent forecasting prices 
 in a first-order self-referential overlapping generations model. We first consider
 intermediate stage learning, where agents update the forecasting rule every
 periods. We show that, in theory and simulations, the learning rule does not 
 converge to the rational expectations equilibrium (REE). We next consider two 
 stage learning, where agents learn the functional mapping between the current 
 forecast function and the previous forecast function. We show that in theory and 
 simulations the two stage learning rule converges to the REE.

Abstract: A dominant explanation of price rigidity is the so-called "menu cost model"
 according to which small costs of changing prices may imply that firms keep nominal
 prices unchanged to nominal shocks which therefore have real effects. Crucial to this
 explanation is the assumption that price adjustment is costly while quantity adjustment
 is not. This paper analyses the role of costs of adjusting both prices and quantities, and
 it is found that the "small cost" argument used to support menu cost models does not
 hold. The predictions of menu cost models only hold if price adjustment costs are larger
 than quantity adjustment costs. Empirical evidence clearly indicates that the costs of
 adjusting quantities are non-trivial. Quantity adjustment costs also open for the possibility
 of non-market clearing.

Abstract: Standard models of imperfectly competitive labour market predict that real
 wages are unaffected by productivity. This is in conflict with empirical evidence. We
 integrate imperfectly competitive labour markets in a fully specified dynamic
 macromodel. While temporary shocks are consistent with the business cycle fact of little
 real wage and large employment responsiveness, we find in accordance with empirical
 evidence that permanent productivity changes affect real wages and not employment.
 Hence, the model solves the productivity puzzle and is capable of matching both business
 cycle and long-run facts concerning movements of real wages and employment.

Abstract: A new approach recently suggested by Hamilton for flexible parametric
 inference in nonlinear models is examined through simulation studies. Hamilton suggests
 a new test for neglected nonlinearity and we compare it with the neural network test,
 Tsay's test, White's dynamic misspecification test, Ramsey's Reset test, the so-called V23
 test, and the nonparametric BDS test. With respect to size and power properties, the
 results on the relative performance of Hamilton's test are very encouraging. In particular,
 we find that against almost all the nonlinear alternatives where the size and power
 properties of the popular neural network test are good the size and power properties of
 Hamilton's new test are even better. Secondly, we examine the convergence properties
 of Hamilton's estimator of the conditional mean function. Our finding suggest that in the
 case of a true linear relationship, the costs of using the flexible nonlinear approach in
 terms of efficiency and speed of convergence are minor. We also show that for many
 nonlinear models the percentage improvement in fit relative to the linear least squared
 estimator can be substantial. Finally, we present evidence showing that in finite samples
 the flexible regression approach suggested by Hamilton clearly outperforms the neural
 network regression approach in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: It is a robust result that the average government (ruling a normal election
 period) in an established democracy loses about 2¬% of the vote. Three explanations
 exist: (i) The coalition-of-minorities theory. (ii) The median-gap theory. (iii) The
 grievance-asymmetry theory. These theories can all be calibrated to explain the fact.
 While (i) is difficult to justify, both (ii) and (iii) are integrated into other theories: (ii) is
 integrated into the "median-voter-complex" that rules out the existence of partisan cycles.
 (iii) is integrated into the "loss-aversion-complex" that via the grievance asymmetry
 provides a "deep-parameter" explanation of the cost-of ruling. It is also an important
 explanation for the partisan cycle model. We demonstrate that the two complexes are
 alternatives and argue that the loss-aversion-complex is more powerful.

Abstract: The propagation of nominal shocks is analyzed in a fully specified stochastic
 intertemporal two-country model. We show how to solve for the equilibrium analytically
 and analyze the role of real and nominal propagation mechanisms. First we consider the
 dynamic implications of nominal shocks having an impact effect due to one-period
 nominal contracts when the propagation over time runs via a basic real propagation
 mechanism in open economies (current account). We find that this case is characterized
 by strong persistency in the real effects of nominal shocks, but the dynamic adjustment
 path is strongly at odds with empirical evidence. Secondly, we introduce a nominal
 propagation mechanism in the form of staggered nominal contracts. This turns out to
 imply a radical change in the dynamic response to nominal shocks, and to generate a
 dynamic adjustment path of the form observed empirically.

Abstract: The 1998 corruption index from Transparency International is explained by two
 types of cross-country models: The economic model uses the level and growth of real
 income per capita, the rate of inflation and the amount of economic freedom. The cultural
 model uses a set of dummies for cultural areas and the level of democracy. It is
 demonstrated that both models work and have a strong interaction. The strongest factor
 reducing corruption is the transition from poor to rich. The (relative) difference between
 GDP-levels within the same cultural area is smaller than the (relative) difference between
 the levels of corruption, so the interaction points to something entirely different from
 culture: the inherent seesaw dynamics of corruption.

Abstract: This paper develops a two-country model of international trade with Cournot
 competition. The labor markets are unionized so that a trade union bargains efficiently
 with each firm over wage and employment. It is shown that if the bargaining power of
 unions differs among countries then, as trade costs are reduced, the country with
 relatively weak unions gradually acquires all firms. However, for a range of trade costs
 it is also a locally stable equilibrium for all firms to locate in the country with strong
 unions.

Abstract: We study a dynamic model of asset pricing which is driven by two characteristic
 market features: the law of investor demand (e.g. 'buy low, sell high') and the law of the
 market institution (which codifies the trading rules under which the market operates). We
 demonstrate in a simple investor-specialist trading market that these features are sufficient
 to guarantee an equilibrium where investors' trading strategies and the specialist's rule
 of price adjustments are best responses to each other. The drift term appearing in the
 resulting equation of the asset price process may be interpreted using Newtonian
 mechanics as the acceleration of a 'market force'. If either of the market participants is
 risk-neutral, the result leads to risk-neutral asset pricing (e.g. the Black and Scholes
 option pricing formula).

Abstract: The present paper offers a careful description on empirical identification of
 possible multiple changes in regime. We apply recently developed tools designed to select
 between regime switching models among a broad class of linear and nonlinear regression
 models and provide a discussion on the impact on the formation of inflation expectations
 in the presence of multiple and recurrent changes in inflation regimes. Our empirical
 findings give a plausible explanation why the rational expectation hypothesis based on
 direct measures of inflation expectations from survey series is typically rejected due to
 large systematic differences between actual and expected inflation rates. In particular, our
 results indicate that in the case of changing and not perfectly observed inflation regimes,
 inference about rationality and unbiasedness based on a comparison of ex ante forecasts
 from survey series and actual inflation rate based on ex post realizations, will be
 ambiguous due to the presence of an ex post bias. The empirical findings are based on
 Danish inflation rates covering the period from 1957-1998. We show that it is not
 possible to reject the hypothesis of multiple inflationary regimes and that the actual
 inflation rate can be represented by a two state Markov regime switching model. It turns
 out that the real time forecasts produced from this model exhibit a large degree of
 similarity when compared to the direct measures of inflation expectations. The result
 illustrates the important impact of switching regimes on the formation of actual and
 expected inflation and hence of ex post bias as a main contributor to the difference
 between actual and expected inflation observed directly from survey series.

Abstract: The paper commences by a discussion of the philosophical foundation of the
 concept of time. Since the concept of equilibrium is inextricably connected with that of
 time, it is argued that economists should be (more) careful when applying the equilibrium
 method; it is not legitimate to apply the concept of equilibrium without an explicit
 definition of the time concept connected with it. Much confusion arises because of
 mixing state of affairs with that of equilibrium.

Abstract: This paper shows that incumbent firms could use wage rates to deter entry of
 new firms. Two cases are analyzed. In the first, incumbents determine wages of all firms
 producing the same good (an extreme case of a wage bargaining at the industry-level -a
 kind of bargaining which is prevalent in many European countries-). In the second, each
 firm can choose different wages, knowing that the efficiency of workers depends on their
 wage relative to a wage that they consider fair. In both cases, there are circumstances in
 which incumbents choose high wages in order to deter entry.

Abstract: In this paper we study the employment effects of a budget neutral restructuring
 of taxes levied on employers and employees. We derive conditions for taxes levied on
 workers to have the same employment effects as taxes levied on firms under standard
 processes of wage determination.

Abstract: One of the main results of the theoretical models of wage bargaining is that
 wages are independent of productivity when the production function has a constant
 elasticity. However empirical studies show that in the long run, wages fully react to
 productivity shocks. This paper reconciles both results. It identifies the assumptions that
 yield the theoretical result. By dropping these assumptions it shows that in the short run
 the degree of real wage rigidity increases with the union power. In the long run, real
 wages fully respond to productivity changes.

Abstract: Most hypotheses in limited dependent variable (LDV) models are composite,
 meaning that the null hypothesis H0 does not completely specify the data generating
 process (DGP). In this case, the null specifies only that the DGP belongs to a given set.
 As a consequence, the sampling distribution of a test statistic under H0 is unknown except
 in special cases because it depends on the true DGP in the set specified by H0. The
 problem is how to test the null hypothesis in this situation.  In this paper, the bootstrap
 is used to solve the hypothesis testing problem.

Abstract: The cross-country pattern in the 1998 corruption index from Transparency
 International is explained by a mixed economic-cultural model of corruption: (1) The
 economic model uses the level of real income per capita, the rate of inflation and the level
 of economic freedom. (2) The cultural model uses a set of variables giving the shares of
 11 religions in each country, and the Herfindahl-index for religious diversity. The
 economic model explains the larger part of the variance, but the religions prove to have
 considerable additional explanatory power. The largest divide is within the Christians.
 By far the least corrupt are the Protestant and Anglicans, while Catholics, and other <<Pre-
 Reform>> Christians, deviate to the other side - as do Buddhists. Further, it is demon-
 strated that the more religiously divided a country, the less corrupt it is.

Abstract: The cleaning of Danish schools is produced by one of three forms of
 organization: decentral municipal, central municipal or private. The cost function is
 shown to be well estimated by a trans-log specification of scale and quality of cleaning.
 For small schools the organization makes little difference. For larger schools decentral
 municipal production is the most expensive. On average centralization reduces costs by
 6%, while privatization reduces costs by 29%. These cost gaps are due to the difference
 in ability to exploit the economy of scale.

Title: Economic Development without Fisher Separation: "Trickle-up" or "Trickle-

Abstract: This paper shows that if development is a process of sectorial change, and
 agents are credit constrained, then rising inequality is inherent to the initial phases of
 development. Moreover, wealth inequality is self-enforcing during the initial phases of
 development, where entrepreneurs are credit constrained. Later wealth inequality
 becomes self-defeating if entrepreneurs accumulate enough to become non-constrained.
 We find the conditions under which the long run distribution of wealth is equal, and
 characterize unequal long run distributions of wealth. Unlike much related research, this
 paper does not assume Fisher separation, that is, that utility maximization implies profit
 maximization.

Abstract: It is often argued that FDI hurt workers in the home country simply because
 jobs are moved abroad. Contrary to that view, businessmen often argue that FDI benefit
 home workers because there will be an expansion in the firm. In this paper, we show that
 both views may be correct, and whether home workers end up gaining or losing on FDI
 depend on which kinds of activities the firm moves to the host country. If there is a big
 degree of substitutability (complementariness) between the activities in the home country
 and the host country, it is likely that the workers lose (gain) on FDI.

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to derive measures of ex ante long-term real interest
 rates that satisfy Fisher's notion of a long-run relationship between expectations of
 inflation and nominal interest rates. We do so by adopting a backward-looking approach
 that also takes account of the increasing integration of financial markets by allowing for
 global influences of national bond rates. The results point to long memories in the
 inflation formation process as well as to significant international linkages. Moreover,
 once these effects are allowed for, expectations of inflation and long-term bond rates
 appear to be co-integrated with co-integration vectors of unity. However, whether the
 measures derived provide better estimates of agents' actual perceptions of ex ante real
 rates than those commonly used remains to be seen, as we do not test their forecasting
 ability.

Title: Product Market Integration and European Labour Markets

Abstract: European labour markets are in a state of flux due to the changing market
 situation induced by international integration. This process affects wage formation
 through more fierce product market competition and increased mobility of jobs. This
 development is by some observers taken to enforce labour market flexibility, while it for
 others signals an erosion of social standards and in turn possibly the welfare society.
 Since labour is not very mobile in Europe, the effects of international integration on
 labour markets is mostly indirect via product market integration. We review the channels
 through which product market integration affects labour markets and perform an
 empirical analysis of the convergence and interdependencies in wage formation among
 EU-countries. We find that integration is changing labour market structures and inducing
 wage convergences as well as stronger wage interdependencies, but it is a gradual
 process. Moreover, the present study does neither support that international integration
 will lead to a "race to the bottom" and rapidly erode domestic labour markets standards
 nor that it will relieve politicians of the need to consider labour market reforms to
 improve labour market performance.
