Abstract: Do people move to cities because of marriage market considerations? In cities
singles can meet more potential partners than in rural areas. Singles are
therefore prepared to pay a premium in terms of higher housing prices. Once
married, the marriage market benefits disappear while the housing premium remains.
We extend the model of Burdett and Coles (1997) with a distinction between efficient
(cities) and less efficient (non-cities) search markets. One implication of the
model is that singles are more likely to move from rural areas to cities while
married couples are more likely to make the reverse movement. A second prediction
of the model is that attractive singles benefit most from a dense market
(i.e. from being choosy). Those predictions are tested with a unique Danish dataset.

Abstract: A frequent criticism of unit root tests concerns the poor
power and size properties that many of such tests exhibit. However, the past
decade or so intensive research has been conducted to alleviate these problems
and great advances have been made. The present paper provides a selective
survey of recent contributions to improve upon both size and power of unit root
tests and in so doing the approach of using rigorous statistical optimality criteria
in the development of such tests is stressed. In addition to presenting tests
where improved size can be achieved by modifying the standard Dickey-Fuller
class of tests, the paper presents theory of optimal testing and the construction
of power envelopes for unit root tests under different conditions allowing for
serial correlation, deterministic components, assumptions regarding the initial
condition, non-Gaussian errors, and the use of covariates.

Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for coping with problems often encountered
when modeling seasonal high frequency data containing both flow and stock variables.
The idea is to apply a multivariate weekly representation of a daily periodic model and
to exploit the possible cointegration and common feature properties of the variables
in order to obtain a more parsimonious model representation. We introduce the
notion of common periodic correlations, which are common features that co-vary -
possibly with a phase shift - across the di?erent days of the week and possibly also
across weeks. The paper also suggests a way of modelling the dynamic interaction
of stock and flow variables within a periodic setting that is similar to the concept of
multicointegration among integrated variables. The proposed modelling framework
is applied to a data set of daily arrivals and departures in the airport of Mallorca.

Abstract: This paper studies equilibrium effect of fiscal policy
disturbances within a dynamic general equilibrium model where tax
evasion and underground activities are explicitly incorporated.
There are three main results. (i) The underground sector
mitigates the distortionary impact of fiscal policies, while
lessening the drop (and the rise) of aggregate production after
restrictive (expansionary) tax shocks. (ii) Tax evasion
and underground economy can be seen as an economic mechanism that
rationalizes the arise of non-keynesian effects in response to fiscal
policy shocks. (iii) A dynamic general equilibrium with
tax evasion gives a rational justification for a Laffer curve.

Abstract: Delineation of the relevant market forms a pivotal part of most antitrust
cases. The standard approach is sequential. First the product market
is delineated, then the geographical market is defined. Demand and
supply substitution in both the product dimension and the geographical
dimension will normally be stronger than substitution in either dimension.
By ignoring this one might decide first to define products narrowly and
then to define the geographical extent narrowly ignoring the possibility of
a diagonal substitution. These reflections are important in the empirical
delineation of product and geographical markets. Using a unique data set
for prices of Norwegian and Scottish salmon, we propose a methodology
for simultaneous market delineation and we demonstrate that compared
to a sequential approach conclusions will be reversed.

Abstract: A unique data set enables us to test the hypothesis that more economists than
otherwise identical investors hold stocks due to informational advantages. We
confirm that economists have a significantly higher probability of participating
in the stock market than investors with any other education, even when controlling
for several background characteristics. We make use of a large register-based
panel data set containing detailed information on the educational attainments
and various financial and socioeconomic variables. We model the stock market
participation decision by the probit model. The results are shown to be highly
robust to various assumptions, including unobserved individual heterogeneity

Abstract: Danish unemployment assistance depends on age; it increases by 70% when unemployed
individuals turn 25. This feature is used to identify the impact of income on the
unemployment-to-employment hazard rate. A mixed proportional hazard framework
based on a 10% representative Danish registry data set is used. The results indicate
that the income effect for females is negative and significant, corresponding to an 
income elasticity of -0.4. The effect for males is positive but insignifcant.

Abstract: In this paper I analyse to what degree availability and price of high quality
publicly subsidised child care affects female employment for women living in
couples following maternity leave. The results show that unrestricted access
to day care has a significantly positive effect on female employment. The
price effect is significantly negative: An increase in the price of child
care of C=1 will decrease the female employment with 0.08% corresponding
to a price elasticity of -0.17. This effect prevails during the first 12
months after childbirth.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effects of different fiscal policies on the firm choice
to produce underground. We consider a tax evading firm operating simultaneously both
in the regular and in the underground economy. We suggest that such a kind of firm,
referred to as moonlighting firm, is able to offset the specific costs usually stressed by
literature on underground production, such as those suggested by Loayza (1994) and
Anderberg et al. (2003). Investigating the effects of different fiscal policy interventions,
we find that taxation is a critical parameter to define the size of capital allocation in
the underground production. In fact, a strong and inverse relationship is found, and
tax reduction is the best policy to reduce the convenience to produce underground. We
also confirm the depressing effect on investment of taxation (see, for instance, Summers,
1981), so that tax reduction has no cost in terms of investment. By contrast, the model
states that while enforcement is an effective tool to reduce capital allocation in the
underground production, it also reduce the total capital stock. Moreover, we also suggest
that the allowance of incentives to capital accumulation may generate, in this specific
typology of firm, some unexpected effects, causing, together with a positive investment
process, also an increase in the share of irregularity. This finding could explain, in a
microeconomic framework, the evidence of Italian southern regions, where high incentives
are combined with high irregularity ratios.

Abstract: This paper estimates a reduced form multi-sector real business cycle model that allows for sectorspecific
and cross-sector shocks of two different types: technology shocks and non-technology shocks.
Long run restrictions identify the different kinds of shocks. There are four main findings.
(i) Sector-specific technology shocks explain more than 70 percent of volatility’s productivity on
a sector-by-sector basis; sector-specific non-technology shocks explain, on the other hand, more than
80 percent of employment volatility in each sector. This suggests that technology shocks matters for
explaining within-sector productivity fluctuations.
(ii) Cross-sector technology shocks have very little explanatory power on productivity and
employment, while cross-sector non-technology shocks explain more than 60 percent of employment
that is reallocated across sector; this suggests that the shocks’ transmission mechanism operates
through non-technology shocks.
(iii) There is no evidence of an aggregate technology shocks for the United States economy;
looking at the aggregate economy might produce misleading results because the relatively larger
sectors drive the dynamic behavior of the aggregate economy. In this respect a disaggregate analysis
may shed light on the mechanisms behind the propagation of shocks across sectors and over time.
(iv) Finally, our analysis suggests that an appropriate real business model for the United States
economy requires at least two sectors, representing, for example, durable and non-durable goods. The
non-durable sector may follow a standard RBC model, while the durable sector should incorporate
consumption habit formation.

Abstract: The AEL (aid effectiveness literature) studies the macroeconomic effect of development aid 
using cross-country or panel data econo¬metrics. It contains about 100 papers of which 43 
study whether development aid increases accumulation in the recipient country. Taking all 43 
aid-accumulation studies together, the results show that aid has a small insignificant positive 
effect on investment, and a (fairly) small significant negative effect on domestic savings. The 
aggregate result is thus an unclear effect on accumulation, but with regional differences.
When only studies of Latin American or Asian economies are considered, a small positive 
and statistically significant investment effect is found, together with a small negative effect on 
domestic savings. We conclude that in Asia and Latin America, aid is a substitute to domestic
savings, but has a net positive impact on investment.

Abstract: The AEL (aid effectiveness literature) is econo¬metric studies of the macroeconomic effects of 
development aid. It contains about 100 papers of which 68 are reduced form estimates of the
 effect of aid on growth in the recipient country. The raw data show that growth is 
unconnected to aid, but the AEL has put so much structure on the data that all results possible 
have emerged. The present meta study considers both the best-set of the 68 papers and the 
all-set of 543 regressions published. Both sets have a positive average aid-growth elasticity, 
but it is small and insignificant: The AEL has not established that aid works. Using meta-
regression analysis it is shown that about 20 factors influence the results. Much of the 
variation between studies is an artifact and can be attributed to publication outlet, institu¬
tional affiliation, and specification differences. However, some of the difference between
studies is real. In particular, the aid-growth association is stronger for Asian countries, and 
the aid-growth association is shown to have been weaker in the 1970s.

Abstract: The AEL (aid effectiveness literature) studies the effect of development aid using econome¬
trics on macro data. It contains about 100 papers of which a third analyzes conditional 
models where aid effectiveness depends upon z, so that aid only works for a certain range of 
the variable. The key term in this family of AEL models is thus an interaction term of z times 
aid. The leading candidates for z are a good policy index and aid itself. In this paper, meta-
analysis techniques are used (i) to determine whether the AEL has established the said 
interaction terms, and (ii) to identify some of the determinants of the differences in results 
between studies. Taking all available studies in consideration, we find no support for 
conditionality with respect to policy, while conditionality regarding aid itself is dubious. 
However, the results differ depending on the authors’ institutional affiliation.

Abstract: The AEL consists of empirical macro studies of the effects of development aid. At the end of 
2004 it had reached 97 studies of three families, which we have summarized in one study each 
using meta-analysis. Studies of the effect on investments show that they rise by 1/3 of the aid – 
the rest is crowded out by a fall in savings. Studies of the effect on growth show an 
insignificant positive effect. Studies of the effect on growth, conditional on something else, 
have till now shown weak results. The Dutch Disease effect of aid has been ignored. The best 
aggregate estimate is that since its start in the early 1960s aid has increased the standard of 
living in the poor countries by 20%.

Abstract: Aid flows are included into the standard cross-country catch-up relation. Robust¬ness of the 
result is tested by changing time periods and by adding extra variables. The main results are:
Absolute conver¬gence and absolute aid effec¬ti¬ve¬ness are both rejected. While conditional 
convergence is accepted, conditional aid effecti¬ve¬ness is found to be weak. The two relations 
are largely inde¬pendent. However, aid has a clear activity effect in the short run. Finally, we
try to divide the countries into an A-group where aid is effective and a B-group where it 
harms. Several criteria of division were explored, but none were very successful – the most 
satisfactory is the one that divides countries according to their level of development.

Abstract: We consider “must-sell” auctions with asymmetric buyers. First,
we study auctions with two asymmetric buyers, where the distribution
of valuations of the strong buyer is “stretched” relative to that of the
weak buyer. Then, it is known that ineffcient first-price auctions are
more profitable for the seller than effcient second-price auctions. This
is because the former favor the weak buyer. However, we show that
the seller can do one better by augmenting the first-price auction by
a pre-auction offer made exclusively to the strong buyer. Should the
strong buyer reject the offer, the object is simply sold in an ordinary
first-price auction. The result is driven by the fact that the unmodified
first-price auction is too favorable to the weak buyer, and that the
pre-auction offer allows some correction of this to the benefit of the
seller. Secondly, we show quite generally that pre-auction offers never
increase the profitability of second-price auctions, since they introduce
the wrong kind of favoritism from the perspective of seller profits.

Abstract: The functioning of electricity markets has experienced increasing complexity
as a result of deregulation in recent years. Consequently this affects the 
multilateral price behaviour across regions with physical exchange of power. 
It has been documented elsewhere that features such aslong memory and regime 
switching reflecting congestion and non-congestion periods are empirically 
relevant and hence are features that need to be taken into account when 
modeling price behavior. In the present paper we further elaborate on the 
co-existence of long memory and regime switches by focusing on the effect 
that the direction of possible congestion episodes has on the price dynamics. 
Under non-congestion prices are identical. The direction of possible congestion 
is identified by the region with excess demand of power through the sign of 
price differences and hence three different states can be considered: Non-congestion 
and congestion periods with excess demand in the one or the other region. Using 
data from the Nordic power exchange, Nord Pool, we find that the price dynamics
and long memory features of the price series generally are rather different
across the different states. Also, there is evidence of fractional cointegration
at some grid points when conditioning on the states.

Abstract: This paper generates high frequency data for the underground labor
and the underground production using a theoretical general equilibrium
model, over the sample 1970:01-1992:04 (32 years; 128 observations). We
compare selected time series properties of the generated series with those
of the corresponding series estimated with classical methodologies. The
generated series for underground labor and underground production present a
wider range and are more volatile than all other series estimated with
classical methodologies. The analysis, next, suggests that the underground
labor is pro-cyclical with respect to the GDP, that is lagging it by
approximately one quarter, and that underground labor series generated from
the theoretical model are highly persistent. Finally, the estimated
correlation between the cyclical component of our generated-from-theory
underground labor productivity and the actual series of aggregate GDP is
negative (-0.34), while official yearly estimates present a positive (but
very low) correlation with the cyclical component of GDP (0.12). This
suggests that the underground sector has a positive impact over the
productivity at the business cycle frequency, while it dampens productivity
fluctuations at a lower frequency.

Abstract: The paper explores the interdependencies between corporate and individual leniency
programs. In a duopoly model where corporations are separated into representing
owners and operating managers, conflicts between the two types of agents arise if
the relative benefits of participating in the corresponding leniency programs differ.
As an example of what might cause differing relative benefits, the paper considers
the inclusion of damage payments for owners which are not covered by the corporate
leniency program. The main findings are: (1) Individual leniency applications are never
observed. (2) Threats by managers to apply for individual leniency may, however,
increase the owners’ incentive to carry out corporate self-reports. (3) In other cases,
the individual leniency program increases the owners’ tolerance for cartel activity for
two reasons: Either the corporate leniency program is sufficiently unattractive to the
owners, or the owners rely on the option to apply for corporate leniency after the
Antitrust Authority has opened a case. (4) Finally, the more distortion decreases, the
more ineffective the individual leniency program becomes.

Abstract: As is broadly recognized, the straightforward application of the Diamond-Mirrlees 
(1971) production efficiency theorem implies that when lump-sum taxation is not 
available, then it is optimal for the government in a small open economy to rely 
on taxes on the net demand of households rather than on border taxes to finance its 
resource requirements. However, the theorem does not hold when taxation is associated 
with administrative costs. The present paper explores the implications for optimal 
taxation and for desirable directions of tax-tariff reform in countries at different 
levels of economic development taking into account the costs of tax administration. 
The paper lends support to and clarifies the reasons for the criticism by Emran and 
Stiglitz (2003, 2005) of the IMF and the World Bank's recommendation to developing 
countries to adopt VAT to replace border taxes.

Abstract: For a small open economy where the government is restricted to raise revenue using
border taxes only, the optimal structure of border taxes is considered. As a matter 
of normalization exports and the supply to the market of the primary factor may be 
assumed to be untaxed, but that the household use of the primary factor and domestic 
consumption of the export good cannot be taxed is nevertheless a constraint; this 
insight provides the key to understanding what determines the optimal tariff structure. 
The optimal border tax structure is derived for both exogenous and endogenous labour 
supply, and the results are interpreted in the spirit of the Corlett-Hague results 
for the optimal tax structure in a closed economy and compared with results from CGE 
models.

Abstract: The introduction of road pricing has important budgetary and income distributional 
consequences. In countries like Denmark, due to high marginal rates of taxation, raising 
government revenue and redistributing income is associated with substantial distortionary and 
administrative costs. This paper argues that an evaluation of the introduction of road pricing 
needs to take into account not only the effects on congestion and on the environment, but also 
the effects on the government’s budget and the income distributional consequences and 
therefore should be undertaken within a general equilibrium framework. A stylized 
Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model which represents the interaction of the 
consumption of transport and of traffic congestion with leisure is used to illustrate this point. 
Model simulations show that the introduction of road pricing may be associated with a double 
dividend and make it desirable to reduce transport infrastructure, and furthermore, although 
decreasing road congestion, increase the environmental damage.
