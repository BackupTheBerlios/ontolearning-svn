Abstract: The effects of systematic sampling and temporal aggregation on the seasonal cycle model (see
Miron, 1993) and the seasonally integrated process (see Hylleberg et al., 1990) are discussed.
The temporal aggregation theory is used to improve the sequential test for monthly seasonal
unit roots of Rodrigues and Franses (2003). It is shown by simulation that the monthly
sequential test has better finite sample properties than the BM test (see Beaulieu and Miron,
1993). The new test is applied to monthly US Industrial Production and, contrary to the BM
test, rejects the presence of any seasonal unit root.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a regime switching model which can generate long memory
(fractional integration) in each of the regime states. This property is relevant in a number of
cases. For instance, the deregulated market for electricity power in the Nordic countries is
characterized by electricity spot prices with a high degree of long memory. It occurs that in
some time periods bilateral prices are identical whereas in other periods the prices differ. The
latter occurs when a capacity congestion exists across regions and multiple price areas will
result. If the price series are fractionally integrated this means that in some regimes, an
extreme form of fractional cointegration amongst prices will exist. We define a Markov
switching fractional integration model from which the fractional orders of integration in
separate states can be estimated using Maximum Likelihood techniques. The model is
adapted to data for the Nordic electricity spot market, and we find that regime swithing and
long memory are empirically relevant to co-exist. In particular, we find that the price
behaviour for single markets can be very different depending upon the presence or absence of
bottlenecks in electricity transmission. Using Monte Carlo forecasting we find that the regime
switching model appears to be especially attractive in forecasting relative prices.

Abstract: A stochastic general equilibrium model is set up in order to analyse whether automatic
stabilizers are a good tool in terms of mitigating risk. It is found that the potential
benefits to be derived from automatic stabilizers depend on various factors including the
degree of real wage rigidity and the size of the public sector. In countries with large public
sectors automatic stabilizers in the sense of procyclical tax revenues can provide significant
welfare improvements compared with a passive fiscal policy. For countries with smaller
public sectors the predictions of the model are less favorable.

Abstract: This paper examines the economic and related consequences of immigration from a less
developed country (LDC) to a developed country (DC) in three different stylized cases: A
guest worker society of the Dubai type, an immigrant society of the US type, and a tax-based
welfare state with institutions of the Nordic type. In the Dubai type case it appears that
mutually beneficial decisions can be made, and the same applies to a degree in the US type
case. However, in the Nordic type evolved welfare case, immigration is only an advantage for
the immigrant, especially one with less marketable skills, while it is a disadvantage for the
natives. This poses an additional threat to the continuation of this type of welfare state.

Abstract: In this paper a test is made of whether the Danish electricity producer, Elsam partly or fully
exploits its temporary dominant position in hours of congestion at the Nordic electricity market.
There seems to be evidences suggesting that Elsam is successful in pursuing its objective of having
a price in Western Denmark close to the maximum price of the surrounding and connected areas.

Abstract: We combine two techniques to consistently estimate the effect of active labour market programmes 
and, in particular, active labour market policy regimes. Our aim is to explicitly estimate the threat
effect of active labour market programmes. Based on Danish data (1998-2002) from administrative
registers we find a strong and significantly positive threat effect. The threat effect is shown to
reduce average unemployment duration by approximately three weeks. The implications of this
result are discussed.

Abstract: Faced with ageing populations many European countries may be tempted to 
attract immigrants. One way to do this is to offer tax incentives. Since the decision to
migrate is a discrete choice it should be average taxes that are important for the migration
decision. If, however, the supply of working hours is endogenous it is shown that
marginal taxes are also important for the migration decision, even after controlling for
average taxes. Hence, countries interested in attracting immigrants can do so even
without reducing average taxes by having less progressive tax systems than other
countries.

Abstract: Over the past decade the taxation of e-commerce has been widely discussed among
politicians, tax law experts and economists. To put some perspective on this issue it is
analyzed to what extent e-commerce can actually be taxed and the severity of the ensuing
tax revenue losses following from future growth of e-commerce is discussed. Since the
US and the EU cases differ substantially they are considered separately. Subsequently various arguments supporting the view that e-commerce should receive preferential tax
treatment are considered. Although no firm recommendations can be provided some
interesting topics for future research are suggested.

Abstract: E-commerce in physical goods enhances the degree of product market competition but
leads also to higher trading costs as goods bought through the internet are shipped
individually. Do these features of e-commerce support a case for granting preferential tax
treatment to online shopping? This is investigated using a model with a domestic
monopolistic retailer and foreign competitive producers that can either deliver a physical
good to the retailer (ordinary trade) or directly to domestic consumers (e-commerce).
Although it is possible to construct cases of strictly positive welfare effects the general
result is that granting tax preferences to e-commerce will have ambiguous welfare
consequences.

Abstract: The private investment response to structural reforms in developing countries is 
of paramount importance, both for the future economic growth and the survival of 
the reforms themselves. By employing a sample of countries, recipients of World 
Bank Structural Adjustment Loans, the present paper assesses whether agreements, 
including policy conditionality, represent a positive signal for the private 
sector and translate into capital formation. The empirical investment equation 
adopted is estimated using dynamic panel data econometric methods, allowing for 
simultaneity and country-specific effects. The main result obtained is that, 
while a higher propensity to commit does not seem to affect the private 
investment response, a higher percentage of tied funds might impact negatively 
on the demand of fixed investment.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of relative demand shocks into a
multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. Relative demand shocks
change the instantaneous structure of preferences. Under relative
demand shocks consumer tastes randomly shift across different
commodities, as manifested by unexpected relative increases or
decreases in the marginal utility of the various consumption
goods. There are no exogenous technology (productivity) shocks in
the model. There are three main results. First, the model
proposes an original theoretical mechanism for generating
aggregate fluctuations and sectoral comovement by using
inter-sectoral and idiosyncratic shocks. This mechanism is
complementary to the standard Real Business Cycle theory.
Second, the model is effectively able to reproduce the
main stylized facts of the U.S. economy, also those that the
standard Real Business Cycle model fails to explain.
Third, the model generates a false Solow
Residual, even though there is no technological progress in the
model. Its size and time series properties are analogous to the
actual Solow Residual.

Abstract: This paper introduces underground activities and tax evasion
into a one sector dynamic general equilibrium model with external effects.
The model presents a novel mechanism driving the self-fulfilling prophecies, 
which is triggered by the reallocation of resources to the underground 
sector to avoid the excess tax burden. This mechanism differs from the 
customary one, and it is complementary to it. In addition, the explicit 
introduction of an (even tiny) underground sector allows to reduce the 
aggregate degree of increasing returns required for indeterminacy, and 
for having well behaved input demand schedules (in the sense they slope down).

Abstract: We describe the statistical model used for profiling new unemployed workers in Denmark.
When a worker - during his or her first six months in unemployment - enters the employment
office for the first time, this model predicts whether he or she will be unemployed for
more than six months from that date or not. The case workers' assessment of how to treat
the person is partially based upon this prediction.

Abstract: The detection of additive outliers in integrated variables has attracted
some attention recently, see e.g. Shin et al. (1996), Vogelsang (1999) and
Perron and Rodriguez (2003). This paper serves several purposes. We
prove the inconsistency of the test proposed by Vogelsang, we extend the
tests proposed by Shin et al. and Perron and Rodriguez to the seasonal
case, and we consider alternative ways of computing their tests. We also
study the e?ects of periodically varying variances on the previous tests
and demonstrate that these can be seriously size distorted. Subsequently,
some new tests that allow for periodic heteroskedasticity are proposed.
