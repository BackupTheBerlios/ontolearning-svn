Abstract: The role of additive outliers in integrated time series has attracted
some attention recently and research shows that outlier detection should
be an integral part of unit root testing procedures. Recently, Vogelsang
(1999) suggested an iterative procedure for the detection of multiple additive
outliers in integrated time series. However, the procedure appears
to suffr from serious size distortions towards the finding of too many
outliers as has been shown by Perron and Rodriguez (2003). In this note
we prove the inconsistency of the test in each step of the iterative procedure
and hence alternative routes need to be taken to detect outliers in
nonstationary time series.

Abstract: 
In this paper we analyze investments in human capital assets in a 
way which is standard for financial assets, but not (yet) for human capital 
assets. We study mean-variance plots of human capital assets. We compare 
the properties of human capital returns using a performance measure and by 
sing tests for mean-variance spanning. A risk-return trade-off is revealed, 
hich is not only related to the length of education but also to the type of 
education. We identify a range of educations that are efficient in terms of 
investment goods, and a range of educations that are inefficient, and may be 
chosen for consumption purposes.

Abstract: In static single equation cointegration regression models
the OLS estimator will have a non-standard distribution unless regressors are
strictly exogenous. In the literature a number of estimators have been suggested
to deal with this problem, especially by the use of semi-nonparametric
estimators. Theoretically ideal instruments can be defined to ensure a limiting
Gaussian distribution of IV estimators, but unfortunately such instruments are
unlikely to be found in real data. In the present paper we suggest an IV estimator
where the Hodrick-Prescott filtered trends are used as instruments for
the regressors in cointegrating regressions. These instruments are almost ideal
and simulations show that the IV estimator using such instruments alleviate
the endogeneity problem extremely well in both finite and large samples.

Abstract: The main objective behind the production of seasonally adjusted time series
is to give an easy access to a common time series data set purged of what is
considered seasonal noise. Although the application of o¢ cially seasonally
adjusted data may have the advantage of being cost saving it may also
imply a less e¢ cient use of the information available, and one may apply a
distorted set of data. Hence, in many cases, there may be a need for treating
seasonality as an integrated part of an econometric analysis. In this article
we present several di¤erent ways to integrate the seasonal adjustment into
the econometric analysis in addition to applying data adjusted by the two
most popular adjustment methods.

Abstract: Preparing for the end of life, especially for the prospect of needing long-term 
care, is an important issue facing older Americans.  Those who reach age 65 
have a 40% chance of going into a nursing home in their remaining lifetime, 
and about 10% of those who do will stay there for at least five years.  The 
costs of a stay are high with on average US$70,000 annually for a private 
room.  Long-term stays in nursing homes are, therefore, not likely, but very 
expensive.  In this paper, we examine individual expectations about future 
nursing home entry and study the relationship between these expectations and 
savings behavior, using data from the Health and Retirement Study.  We find a 
clear relation between subjective expectations and probability of future 
nursing home entry, and a positive effect of these expectations on savings 
behavior.  Surprisingly, we find no difference of this effect by wealth group, 
so it seems that Medicaid eligibility in the context of nursing home entry plays 
no factor in the decision to save.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of home ownership on individual job mobility and wages 
in Denmark. We find that home ownership has a negative impact on job-to-job mobility
both in terms of transition into new local jobs and new jobs outside the local labour
market. In addition, there is a clear negative effect of home ownership on the 
unemployment risk and a positive impact on wages. These results are robust to different
strategies for correcting for the possible endogeneity of the home owner variable.

Abstract: This paper explores the ability of a class of one-sector,
multi-input models to generate indeterminate equilibrium paths, and
endogenous cycles, without relying on factors' hoarding. The model
presents a novel theoretical economic mechanism that supports
sunspot-driven expansions without requiring upward sloping labor
demand schedules. Its distinctive characteristic is that the skill
composition of aggregate labor demand drives expansionary i.i.d.
demand shocks. Next, the model explains the labor market dynamics
from the supply side, while endogenizing the capital productivity
response to changes in the aggregate labor demand composition. Last
but not least, it is worth to mention that the model presents an
effective shock propagation mechanism that operates into the labor
market and across labor market segments through the cross
elasticities of equilibrium labor demand and supplies. In this
respect the model can be seen as quite general formulation (with or
without aggregate increasing returns to scale) for analyzing labor
market dynamics within a general equilibrium model with labor market
segmentation.

Abstract: A problem encountered in, for instance, growth empirics is that the number of
explanatory variables is large compared to the number of observations. This makes
it infeasible to condition on all variables in order to determine the importance of a
variable of interest. We prove identifying assumptions under which the problem is
not ill-posed. Under these assumptions, we derive properties of the most commonly
used methods: Extreme bounds analysis, Sala-i-Martin’s method, BACE, generalto-
specific, minimum t-statistics, BIC and AIC. We propose a new method and show
that it has good finite sample properties.

Abstract: In this paper, I analyse the association between workplace sex ratios and partnership 
formation and dissolution. I find that the risk of dissolution increases with the fraction 
of coworkers of the opposite sex at both the female and male workplace. On the other hand, 
workplace sex ratios are not important for the overall transition rate from singlehood 
to partnership. The results suggest that the workplace constitutes a more important 
marriage market segment for individuals who are already in a partnership presumably due 
to higher search cost for (alternative) partners in general.

Abstract: Individuals match on length and type of education. We investigate whether the
systematic relationship between educations of partners is explained by opportuni-
ties (e.g. low search frictions) or preferences (e.g. complementarities in household
production or portfolio optimization). We find that half of the systematic sorting
on education is due to low search frictions in marriage markets of the educational
institutions. The other half is attributed to complementarities in household pro-
duction, since income properties of the joint income process show no influence on
partner selection.

Abstract: Outsourcing of jobs to low-wage countries has increased the focus on
the accumulation of skills - such as Math skills - in high-wage countries.
In this paper, we exploit a high school pilot scheme to identify the causal
effect of advanced high school Math on labor market outcomes. The pilot
scheme reduced the costs of choosing advanced Math because it allowed
for at more flexible combination of Math with other courses. We find
clear evidence of a causal relationship between Math and earnings for the
students who are induced to choose Math after being exposed to the pilot
scheme. The effect partly stems from the fact that these students end up
with higher education.
