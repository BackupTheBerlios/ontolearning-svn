Abstract: In this paper we look at the long run growth implications of
  	labour market distorsions. The analysis is cast in a model where
  	growth is generated by two alternative sources of enhancing labour
  	productivity. The first is that workers before entering the job
  	market may undertake schooling. Secondly, workers may undertake
  	training within firms as unskilled workers and thereby become
  	skilled workers. We investigate how a minimum wage requirement for
  	the unskilled may affect long run growth.
