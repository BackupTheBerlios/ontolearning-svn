Abstract: In a model where privatisation of inefficient
SOE's is performed by allocating shares to different
types of agents in society we analyse
the conflict between shareholder and stakeholder
interests. In particular, some of those that
receive shares in a firm, that suffers from
inefficiency, do have a stakeholder interest
in the same  inefficiency. Additionally, we
introduce a dependence of agent (and hence
firm) decisions on the entire privatisation
program: for one type of share/stakeholder
the effect with which inefficiency enters his
stakeholder interest  can switch sign depending
on the overall economic structure that results
from privatisation. The paper determines the
effects on restructuring (elimination of the
inefficiency) in a general share/stakeholder
conflict setup. It is found that for sensible
specifications of the conflict restructuring
will fall short of complete efficiency. The
dependence of one agents stakeholder function
of the overall privatisation structure, can
amplify this effect. Further we introduce a
privatising government that in this setup
maximises an objective function, taking into
account the overall restructuring level and
political support from the distribution of
shares

Abstract: The restructuring process of formerly state owned
enterprises, including dismissal of excess labour,
has been slow. Since the recovery of transition
economies depends on the restructured sector, a
convincing take-off has been delayed. Many arguments
have been forwarded to explain the low adaptation
speed. This paper focuses on an additional
structural barrier at the governmental level. Here
the privatisation program - leading to restructuring
or not - is designed. Transition governments are in
a fiscal squeeze: on the one hand restructuring
relocates costs from the restructured firms to the
public budget, on the other hand - in order to
contain inflationary pressures - the public deficit
should be kept within narrow limits. This problem
is analysed by means of a stylized, dynamic model.

Abstract: The way 275 Danish municipalities organize 12
tasks shows a complex and changing pattern of
market orientation. It is often discussed as an
ideological issue; but we have failed to find a
significant ideological factor in the pattern.
However, factors belonging to four theories
become significant: (f1) A modernization theory
where the market is the new organization. (f2)
A diffusion process, where the market starts
in the biggest cities. (f3) A welfare coalition
model, where diffusion is blocked if the median
voter receives income from the public sector.
(f4) A pressure theory, where municipalities use
the market if they are forced to save. Finally,
it is shown that the pattern in the Copenhagen
metropolitan area is different from the one in
the provinces.

Abstract: The largest and most altruistic development aid
programs are the ones of a group of countries
known as the Like-Minded Countries. The LMC's
are the small rich NW-European countries and
Canada. The LMC's have developed a distinct
'soft' aid ideology that differs from the
'hard' ideology of other donors. We shall use
the Danish program as an example. The
explanation starts from a dual markets
hypothesis, (a) aid policies are formed at
the LMC markets, where the voters demand
post-material altruism, and (b) projects are
made on a market between the LMC-bureaucracy
and the LDC's demanding development. In
addition, the softness is a consequence of
the normal behaviour of a bureaucracy
demanding power and slack.

Abstract: The role of demand management policy is considered 
in a two-sector open economy model with price-taking 
firms and imperfect competition in the labour market. 
Demand management policies are shown to affect the 
equilibriumdistribution of prices and hence output in 
the case of both supply (productivity) and demand 
(preferences) shocks. As agents are risk-averse, there 
is a welfare case for pursuing an active stabilization 
policy, and the optimal fiscal policy as well as the 
possibility of implementing this via automatic budget 
rules are discussed.

Abstract: Earlier results on estimating markup ratios as indicators of the competitive
pressure are discussed and it is shown that the estimation method suggested by Roeger
(1995) suffers from similar problems as an earlier method suggested by Hall (1988). It
is also shown that the estimating equations applied are prone to autocorrelation and
heteroskedasticity and that a proper treatment of these problems implies estimates of the
markup ratios or more precisely the relation between the markup and the scale factor,
which are smaller than those reported in the literature.

Abstract: A contract between a small country and a large organization is analyzed using
an Edgeworth-Box model. The population of the country is divided into two groups:
people and elite. The contract has two explicit parameters: an exchange of sovereignty
and a net transfer. A small country is defined as one where people consider the power
they gain in the organization to be infinitesimal. The elite recognize that they get a net
opwer gain. Further, there are two implicit parameters, the big-country advantage and
some rents. It is shown that the lens for the elite is much larger than the lens for the
population. In a dynamic integration process the contract will inevitably leave the lens.
It is finally discussed if it is likely that the resistance of people will erode over time.

Abstract: Social capital is defined as mutual trust. It
is related to production by a key hypothesis: social
capital determines how easily people work together.
An easy-to-use proxy (Putnam's Instrument) is the
density of voluntary organizations. Social capital
might be a new production factor which must be added
to human and physical capital, or it might enter as
a reduction in either transaction or monitoring costs.
A direct and an indirect way to measure social capital
is discussed. The crucial question is if social
capital can be changed. That is, if self-enforcement
can replace third-party-enforcement. This is closely
related to the issue of institution building. Finally,
it is discussed how much harm totalitarian regimes do
to social capital, when they expand their area of
central control

Abstract: Restraints on the public budget limit the ability of the public sector to use
financial markets for intertemporal substitution. This interferes with the role of the public
budget as a buffer which provides insurance and possibly stabilizes income and thereby
private consumption. We consider this insurance or stabilizing role of public budgets and
show why a progressive taxation system may be optimal even when the distortionary
effects of taxation are taken into account. Balanced budget restrictions interfere with this
insurance effect, and they do not necessarily imply that a lower level of public
consumption is optimal.

Abstract: In this paper we study the role of fiscal policy in a macroeconomic model with
imperfect competition in the product market. We find that fiscal spending per se and a less
competitive industry reduce the responsiveness of income to productivity shocks. The
government should follow a counter-cyclical fiscal policy if it wants to stabilize income
(against productivity shocks), but this policy is not in the interest of the households which
prefer pro-cyclical fiscal spending. We also analyse the cost of following a nonconditional
fiscal policy rule, and find that it is more costly to do so, when the degree of competition
in the product market is low.

Abstract: Interregional transfers within EU account
for less than 2 % of GDP. These
transfers are redistributive and a federal insurance
system does not exist. In this paper we
analyse the scope for federal insurance and search for
an economic explanation for the
union wide resistance against extending the federal 
budget to include an insurance system.
We find that regional insurance build into the
public budget can make federal insurance
less attractive. The more imperfect the capital
market the more effective is regional
insurance and the less attractive federal insurance
becomes. We analyse the optimal division between
regional and federal insurance and relate it to
the capital market imperfection. The issue of the
optimal number of countries in a fiscal federation
is also discussed. A general finding of the paper is
that union members will have different preferences
for the structure of a federal insurance system and
the decision procedure is therefore important when
discussing the potential design.

Abstract: In this paper we show that the fiscal
multiplier depends on the type of taxation
which the government uses to finance its fiscal
expenditure. If the finance takes place by
an increase in the average tax rate the multiplier
will be positive, but if it takes place by
an increase in the marginal tax rate the sign of
the multiplier is ambiguous, and depends
on the progression of the tax system and the
households elasticity of marginal utility. We
show the implication of this result on the rule
for optimal provision of public goods in a
constrained world where the government has to
resort to distortionary income taxes.

Abstract: Last year one of the decisive arguments
against inviting Latvia to join the group
of  'in' countries was that the European Commission
considered Latvia not to possess the
sufficient economic and political strength to
resist competitive pressure and market forces
in the single market. Thus, if exposed to
international competition, Latvia may feel
inclined to give in to political pressure
from sections of society by imposing protective
measures, which would collide with the rule
of the single  market. Based on a predominantly
economic analysis, this paper challenges
the European Commission's negative
conclusion regarding the competitive strength of
Latvia as it was presented in the Avis on
Latvia in July 1997. The EU reference to the
gains that are collectable within the single
market due to economies of scale can be seen
as a comparative advantage of the applicant
state; the relatively extensive specialisation
cannot be held against Latvia as 'distortion';
she possesses potential comparative advantages
in core industrial sectors, primarily
because of a valuable fund of skilled workers.
More modern capital and managerial know-
how is still needed, however, as is the case in
'in' countries as well. The analysis leads to
the conclusion that Latvia should be able to
resist the inclination to concede to political
or other interest group pressures. Thus, this
argument cannot be used against Latvian
membership. From a position inside the EU it
would be much easier for Latvia to adapt
to European standards as far as the economic
and structural substance is concerned. An
early entry would actually benefit both
Latvia and the EU.

Abstract: Persistent real effects of nominal
shocks is considered in an intertemporal
macromodel with capital accumulation and
staggered nominal wage contracting. By
placing the contracting process in a setting
of imperfect competition it becomes possible
to avoid the standard problem that intertemporal
business cycle models generate plausible
business cycle fluctuations only by assuming
implausible large labour supply elasticities.
It is shown that nominal shocks can have
persistent real effects and that nominal
propagation via staggered nominal wage contracts
substantially strengthens the persistency in
the adjustment process for real output caused
by real mechanisms like capital accumulation.

Abstract: The influence of NAIRU theory on
economic policy is both puzzling and
unfortunate, especially in a European context.
This paper shows that standard rationality
assumptions and objective functions may fail
to generate a well-defined NAIRU in a
unionized economy. It then presents two simple
models with endogenous wage
aspirations. One version of the model produces
a unique long-run NAIRU while the other
implies the presence of aspiration-induced
hysteresis in the employment rate. The
hysteretic version seems preferable on
theoretical grounds and - at a stylized level
- this version also fits the empirical evidence
better than the non-hysteretic version. The
argument implies that an expansionary aggregate
demand policy combined with temporary
incomes policies may reduce European unemployment
permanently without adverse inflationary consequences.

Abstract: In a recent report commissioned by
the Norwegian government, a group of
experts have presented a new framework for
Norwegian competition analysis and policy,
see von der Fehr, Norman, Reve and Ryssdal
(1998). In conclusion, we believe the report
represents a major contribution to the discussion
of competition analysis and policy of the
NCA, and we strongly recommend it to all those
interested in these topics. The proposed
three-step incentive-based approach to analysis
is particularly appealing in terms of its
general perspective on competition policy.
However, we would conjecture that the main
challenge for the proponents of the procedure
is not to convince economists and the
economics profession about the advantage
of an incentive-based approach, but rather to
generate a similar consensus among all the
different groups and agencies that shape
antitrust (and regulation). The three-step
incentive-based approach may be successfully
implemented only if the whole system subscribes
to its philosophical premises, and it may
be hazardous to implement it without creating
an understanding among the participants
beforehand.

Abstract: Conventional banking practices do not
easily accommodate the financial needs
of poor persons. Group-lending, on the other
hand, has found several advantages in the
context of poor borrowers with no collateral
to offer. An important advantage is that the
bank's losses due to unsuccessful projects
are dramatically reduced, because group
members cover at least part of those losses.
In effect, a kind of collateral has been created
in the group even though each individual had no
collateral to offer. This paper will
analyze the collateral-effect in a model with
two types of entrepreneurs (high-risk and
low-risk) and a competitive banking system. We
show that with individual lending, the
typical situation for poor entrepreneurs in
developing countries is likely to lead to a
separating equilibrium where only high-risk
borrowers are served (at a high interest rate).
Allowing for group-lending, however, is likely
to result in a pooling equilibrium, where
all entrepreneurs are served at a considerably
lower interest rate. We complement the
theoretical analysis by a comparison of the
performance of Bolivia's BancoSol, which
practices group-lending, with the other private
Bolivian banks, which lend on an
individual basis.

Abstract: This paper aims at identifying
and quantifying different sources of persistency
in employment adjustment. Based on a dynamic
labour market model an explicit
distinction is made between real and nominal
(prices and wages) propagation mechanisms.
The theoretical analysis provides the basis
for an empirical analysis of nominal wages,
nominal prices and employment for the manufacturing
sector in Denmark 1974.1 to 1993.4. We find that
nominal rigidities prevail in the short run and
that nominal propagation mechanisms play a larger
role than real propagation mechanisms. The
persistency mechanisms identified here are
substantial from a business cycle perspective,
