Abstract: The role of additive outliers in integrated time series has attracted
some attention recently and research shows that outlier detection should
be an integral part of unit root testing procedures. Recently, Vogelsang
(1999) suggested an iterative procedure for the detection of multiple additive
outliers in integrated time series. However, the procedure appears
to suffr from serious size distortions towards the finding of too many
outliers as has been shown by Perron and Rodriguez (2003). In this note
we prove the inconsistency of the test in each step of the iterative procedure
and hence alternative routes need to be taken to detect outliers in
nonstationary time series.
