Abstract: Contrary to existing menu cost models we assume oligopolistic
  	interaction. Symmetric duopoly may lead to asymmetric adjustment
  	even when menu costs are negligible: In some equilibria only one
  	firm adjusts to negative shocks, while both firms adjust to positive
  	shocks.

Abstract: It is by now well known that the presence of small lump sum costs
  	of adjusting prices can lead to nominal price rigidity. However, the
  	argument of adjustment costs could equally well be applied to
  	quantities, thereby leading to rigid quantities. This paper examines
  	the importance of adjustment costs on both prices and quantities in
  	a dynamic monopoly model, where the firm has to decide whether it
  	uses price or quantity or both as the adjustment mechanism to shocks
  	which can be permanent or temporary. It is shown that there is more
  	downward rigidity than upward, and that this asymmetry is enhanced
  	when the quantity adjustment costs consist of linear adjustment
  	costs on top of the lump-sum. Furthermore, prices seem to bear a
  	relatively larger proportion of the adjustment burden when the shock
  	is 'large', and vice versa for quantities when the shock is 'small'.
  	Finally, the firm may be rationed even when adjustment is carried
  	out.

Abstract: Seasonal patterns in economic time series are generally examined
  	from a univariate point of view. Using extensions of the unit root
  	literature, important classes of seasonal processes are
  	deterministic, stationary stochastic or mean reverting, and unit
  	root stochastic. Time series tests have been developed for each of
  	these. This paper examines seasonality in a multivariate context.
  	Systems of economic variables can have trends, cycles and unit roots
  	as well as the various types of seasonality. Restrictions such as
  	cointegration and common cycles are here applied also to examine
  	multivariate seasonal behavior of economic variables. If each of a
  	collection of series has a certain type of seasonality but a linear
  	combination of these series can be found without seasonality, then
  	the seasonal is said to be "common". New tests are developed to
  	determine if seasonal characteristics are common to a set of time
  	series. These tests can be employed in the presence of various other
  	time series structures. The analysis is applied to OECD data on
  	unemployment for the period 1975.1 to 1993.4, and it is found that
  	four diverse countries (Australia, Canada, Japan and USA) not only
  	have common trends in their unemployment, but also have common
  	deterministic seasonal features and a common cycle/stochastic
  	seasonal feature. Such a collection of characteristics were not
  	found in other groups of OECD countries.

Abstract: Much of the economic analysis of local governments assumes that
  	local policymakers operate in a competitive environment where cities
  	produce a level of local public sector output that can be considered
  	"efficient". Efficiency can be quantifies as the highest value of
  	local property tax base possible given the endogenous and exogenous
  	inputs available to a city government. If a city is not producing
  	the highest attainable property value, ceteris paribus, then it
  	could be considered inefficient. In this paper we attempt to measure
  	the relative efficiency of large city governments in the U.S.
  	through the technique of production frontier analysis. In a second
  	stage of our empirical analysis we regress the derived measure of
  	relative inefficiency against variables that have been proposed as
  	causes of public production inefficiency. Our results show that
  	large city governments are operating at different degrees of
  	efficiency and that many of the causal hypotheses advanced in this
  	regard are empirically valid.

Abstract: This paper defends the Aggregate-Supply/Aggregate-Demand framework
  	against recent criticisms by Barro and others. Using four models - a
  	neoclassical-synthesis Keynesian, a monetarist mark I, a rational
  	expectations/new classical, and a Kaleckian/post-Keynesian - based
  	on this framework, it is shown that it provides an internally-
  	consistent and potentially useful teaching tool, that Keynesian
  	versions of it do follow some of Keynes's ideas, that a
  	Kaleckian/post-Keynesian version is consistent with empirical data,
  	and that the criticisms by Barro and others are unwarranted.

Title: The Crisis Of Egalitarian Policy And The Promises Of Asset-Based

Abstract: This paper analyses the links between egalitarian policy and
  	unemployment and the possible use of asset-based redistribution to
  	overcome the crisis of egalitarian policy. Contrary to left-
  	Keynesian belief, egalitarian policies in the postwar period were
  	not the means to ensure high aggregate demand and full employment.
  	The main direction of causation went the other way: full employment
  	generated increasing egalitarian demands while high unemployment
  	after the golden age paved the way for increasing inequality. The
  	breakdown of the golden ages is itself explained by a gradual
  	deterioration of the business climate which undermined the full
  	employment policy. In addition, increasing international mobility
  	raised the costs of redistributive taxation. Asset-based
  	redistribution may, as suggested by Bowles and Gintis, open new
  	possibilities, but the Scandinavian experience with increased worker
  	ownership raises serious questions about the implementation of asset
  	redistribution.

Length: 21 pages
Abstract: This paper derives a method for estimating and testing the Linear
  	Quadratic Adjustement Cost(LQAC) model when the target variable and
  	some of the forcing variables follow I(2) processes. Based on a
  	forward- looking error-correction formulation of the model it is
  	shown how to obtain strongly consistent estimates of the structural
  	long-run parameters and the adjustement cost parameter from both a
  	linear and a non-linear cointegrating regression,where first-
  	differences of the I(2) variables are included as regressors
  	(multicointegration).

Title: Multiple Unit Roots in Periodic Autoregression.
Author-Name:  Boswijk,P.

Author-Name: Haldrup,N.
Keywords: TIME SERIES;DISTRIBUTION
Length: 30 pages
Abstract: In this paper we propose a model selection strategy for a
  	univariate periodic autoregressive time series which involves tests
  	for one or more unit roots and for parameter restrictions
  	corresponding to seasonal unit roots and mutiple unit roots at the
  	zero frequency. Examples of models that are considered are variants
  	of the seasonal unit roots models and the periodic integration
  	model. We show that the asymptotic distributions of various test
  	statistics are the same as well-known distributions which are
  	already tabulated. We apply our strategy to three empirical series
  	to illustrate its of use. We find that evidence for seasonal unit
  	roots based on nonperiodic models disappears when periodic
  	representations are considered.

Title: Separation in Cointegrated Systems,Long Memory Components and Common
  	Stochastic Trends.
Author-Name:  Granger,C.W.J.
Author-Name: Haldrup,N.
Keywords: TRENDS;MODELS;TIME SERIES
Length: 16 pages
Abstract: The notion of separation in cointegrated systems helps identifying
  	possible sub-system structures that may reduce the complexity of
  	larger systems by yielding a more parsimonous representation of the
  	time series. In this paper we demonstrate that although the
  	subsystem cointegration analysis in such systems can be conducted in
  	case of both completely and partially separeted systems, the dual
  	approach, i.e. calculation of the common stochastic trends,may turn
  	out to yield properties of the trends that differ depending upon the
  	type of separation under consideration. In particular,we demonstrate
  	how persistent-transitory decompositions and long- and short-memory
  	factorisations of a multivariate time series will be affected when
  	considering different types of separation. Generalisations to non-linear error correction models are also discussed.

Title: Imperfectly Competitive Factors Markets and Price Normalization.
Author-Name:  Rasmussen, B.S.
Keywords: COMPETITION;GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM;PRICES;TRADE UNIONS
Length: 16 pages
Abstract: A two-sector general equilibrium model with imperfectly
  	competitive labour makets is set up. Non-cooperative equilibria with
  	wage setting at the sectoral level are shown to depend on the choice
  	of price normalization rule even though all agents behave fully
  	rationally. Hence, imposing rationality is not sufficient to deprive
  	the choice of price normalization rule of its importance. It is
  	argued that the importance of the choice of price normalization rule
  	may follow from the strategic interaction of agents and not from
  	imperfectness of competition per se, and some examples are provided.
