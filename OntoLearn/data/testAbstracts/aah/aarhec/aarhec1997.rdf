Abstract: We suggest how to redefine the multicointegration model of Granger
  	and Lee (1990) in terms of an I(2) system and subsequently propose a
  	one-step procedure for estimation and inference which will have
  	favourable statistical properties compared to the two-step procedure
  	suggested by Granger and Lee. With respect to the single equation
  	residual based cointegration procedure for I(2) systems we tabulate
  	new critical values that are necessary to accomodate the presence of
  	deterministic components.

Abstract: This paper shows how competition between interests can internalize
  	economic externalities groups. The key feature is that some lobby
  	groups give political voice to environmental demands. We illustrate
  	the basic ideas in a common agency model of politics, into which we
  	introduce a negative output externality. We show that the
  	politically optimal structure of environmental taxes incorporates
  	the full Pigouvian adjustment. However, since lobby groups care
  	about the distribution of income as well as about efficiency, the
  	equilibrium structure of taxes differs considerably from the set of
  	Pigouvian taxes. In particular, organized sectors get a tax
  	discount, while unorganized sectors are taxed at an inefficiently
  	high rate. Hence, environmental lobbying has a huge beggar-thy-
  	neighbour element.

Abstract: The importance of the design of the income tax system for the
  	incentive to supply effort is considered for both a situation where
  	firms (efficiency wage model) or unions (monopoly union model) have
  	the power to determine wages. A tax reform raising marginal taxes at
  	all income levels and increasing (decreasing) average taxes at high
  	(low) income levels may lead to higher wages, lower employment and
  	higher unemployment under either wage determination regime.

Abstract: Danish development aid is analyzed by visiting a sample of
  	projects five years after their completion. The sample is stratified
  	to nine countries chosen to be main, peaceful recipients in the main
  	regions. The criterion of success is if the projects do what it is
  	meant to. If we think the project would not have been accepted by
  	Danida given present knowledge, it gets 0 to 2 points, and vice
  	versa from 2 to 4 points. The average project obtains 2.16 points,
  	but as our selection process has a couple of small upward biases, it
  	is dubious if the true average is above 2. Projects in Africa,
  	agriculture and parastatals are negative outliers with 3/4 to 1
  	point, while projects in East Asia get 1 point more. There are some
  	indications that Danida is more successful with small projects and
  	NGO-projects. The soft, informal, multi-goal decision process used
  	by Danida is discussed.

Abstract: In the quarterly Danish sample based wage statistics firms within
  	a given industry are randomly selected with probabilities
  	proportional to size. The hourly mean wage per employee is
  	registered within each selected firm. Then the population mean per
  	employee is estimated by the pps-estimator, i.e. the simple mean of
  	the selected firm means per employee. I raise the question: Is it
  	possible to produce better confidence intervals for the population
  	mean by using trimmed means instead of the simple mean when the
  	iterated bootstrap is used? Monte Carlo experiments indicate that it
  	is the case.

  	selective marketing efforts towards potential users, and (iv) the
  	existence of policy effects on consumer loyalty as well as on the
  	static price elasticity of demand facing individual suppliers at any

Abstract: Kaldor's Mattioli lectures analyse a two-sector model with
  	increasing returns to scale (IRS) in industry and decreasing returns
  	(DRS) in agriculture. This review article shows that (i) with IRS in
  	industry a long-run equilibrium growth path with strictly positive
  	growth rates may exist even if agriculture is subject to DRS; (ii)
  	the industrial sector is the 'engine of growth' if agricultural
  	investment is determined passively by available saving; (iii) if one
  	introduces a separate agricultural investment function both positive
  	and negative agricultural supply shocks may lead to stagnation, thus
  	vindicating Kaldor's emphasis on commodity price stabilization.

Abstract: In econometrics, most null hypotheses are composite, dividing the
  	parameters into parameters of interest and nuisance parameters.
  	Typically, a composite hypothesis can be tested using two or more
  	testing procedures. Competing testing procedures are commonly
  	compared using size-corrected powers. What is often overlooked is
  	that the size-corrected critical value of a test can be sensitive to
  	the set of admissible values of the nuisance parameters, and hence
  	its size-corrected power. As a result, different choices for the
  	admissible set can produce different conclusions about which test is
  	best. This fact complicates the interpretation of Monte Carlo power
  	studies because in many cases there is no natural definition of the
  	set of admissible values. We find this fact to be crucial when
  	choosing a Lagrange Multiplier test in the case of a logit model. A
  	theoretical explanation for this effect is developed using large
  	parameter asymptotics.

Abstract: Multicointegration, in the sense of Granger and Lee (1990),
  	frequently occurs in models of stock-flow adjustment and implies
  	cointegration amongst I(2) variables and their differences
  	(polynomial cointegration). The purpose of this article is two-fold.
  	First, we demonstrate that based on a multicointegrated vector
  	autoregression (VAR) two equivalent error correction model (ECM)
  	representations can be derived; the first is expressed in terms of
  	adjustments in the flows of the variables (the standard I(2) ECM),
  	and the second is expressed in terms of adjustments in both the
  	stocks and the flows. Secondly, we apply I(2) estimation and testing
  	procedures for multicointegrated time series to analyze data for US
  	housing construction. We find that stocks of housing units started
  	and completed exhibit polynomial cointegration (and hence the flows
  	are multicointegrated) and the associated ECM's are estimated. Lee
  	(1992, 1996) also found multicointegration in this data set but
  	without explicitly exploiting the I(2) property.

Abstract: Nominal rigidities imply that nominal shock have an impact effect
  	which may be propagated by standard mechanisms. However, the nominal
  	adjustment process may in itself be a propagation mechanism causing
  	persistent effects of nominal shocks. This may be caused by inertia
  	in nominal wage and price adjustment arising due to input- output
  	networks or multiperiod nominal contracting as captured in models
  	with staggered price/wage decisions. It has recently been contested
  	whether staggering can account for persistency of any quantitative
  	importance. This paper reviews the theory and empirical evidence on
  	this issue and it is concluded that staggering may be a quantitative
  	important propagation mechanism.

Title: Modelling the Relationship between Government Policy, Economic

Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical as well as an empirical model of
  	deforestation and economic development in a tropical forest economy.
  	The empirical model is estimated using panel data for 316
  	municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon during the period 1970-1985.
  	The effects of controversial Brazilian policies, such as road
  	building through the Amazon and subsidized credit to agricultural
  	establishments, are evaluated both in the theoretical model and in
  	the estimated empirical model. The paper concludes that subsidized
  	credit, while certainly causing deforestation, is so beneficial for
  	economic growth that the benefits seem to outweigh the environmental
  	costs. This does not hold for road building, however, because the
  	opening up of new land by federal road building tend to promote a
  	wasteful use of land. The effects of controversial Brazilian policies , like road building through the Amazon and subsidized credit to agricultural establishments , are evaluated both in the theoretical model and in the estimated empirical model. 	The effects of controversial Brazilian policies , mainly road building through the Amazon and subsidized credit to agricultural establishments , are evaluated both in the theoretical model and in the estimated empirical model.

Abstract: This paper offers a political model of green tax reforms in which
  	the use of the revenue from the ecotax is an integrated part. We use
  	the model to explain why and when a link between an ecotax and cuts
  	in other non-environmental taxes can be expected. In our model,
  	green tax swaps arise because a producer lobby group, even if the
  	use of the revenue does not affect profits per se, takes an interest
  	in the allocation of revenue from the ecotax. The reason being that
  	the lobby group uses the allocation of the revenue to reduce the
  	'price' of other political favours that it cares a lot about. To
  	this end, the lobby group acts in the best interest of the voters,
  	and to the extent the the voters prefer tax cuts on labour income.
  	The paper also analyses the environmental impact of various
  	budgetary procedures and discusses to what extent the revenue from
  	an ecotax can be used to create a constituency in favour of the
  	environmental protection.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider strategic entry decisions in a two-
  	player political transfer contest, i.e. the prize is a transfer from
  	one lobby group to another. The size of the transfer depends on the
  	lobbying effort of the political active lobby groups. We show that
  	the entry decision involves a trade-off between an influence loss
  	and a strategic gain. The influence loss is related to the value of
  	the foregone option to influence policymaking. The strategic gain is
  	related to the strategic behaviour of the competitor. The existence
  	of symmetric equilibria in which both lobby groups enter the contest
  	and asymmetric equilibria in which only one lobby group enters is
  	proved. In the latter type of equilibrium, rent-seeking expenditures
  	are substantially reduced, and the strategic behaviour of the active
  	lobby group acts as a barrier to entry by rewarding the competitor
  	for staying out of the contest.

Abstract: Equilibrium allocations in competitive labour market models are
  	independent of whether labour taxes on firms are levied as
  	employment taxes or payroll taxes, for given tax revenue. Turning to
  	non-competitive labour market models, like wage bargaining of
  	efficiency wage models, the two taxes cease to be equivalent in the
  	sense that balanced-budget substitutions of one tax for the other
  	affect equilibrium allocations. However, while more extensive use of
  	payroll taxes always increases equilibrium employment in the wage
  	bargaining model, it may lead to a lower level of equilibrium
  	employment in the efficiency wage model.

Abstract: This paper develops a two-country, two-sector model of
  	international trade with increasing returns to scale in one sector.
  	Free trade leads to asymmetric equilibria even when both countries
  	are identical with respect to technology, tastes and factor
  	endowments. For some parameter values, trade leads to a uniform
  	welfare improvement in both countries, while for others it can give
  	rise to uneven development in the sense of persistent disparities in
  	wages, income and welfare. In the latter case, distortionary
  	industrial policy by the less developed country may be welfare
  	enhancing. If the dynamics of policy changes are endogenized, the
  	model gives rise to periodic changes in industrial leadership or
  	leapfrogging. Implications of this phenomenon for the empirical
  	literature on convergence are discussed.

Abstract: Excess distortions in the welfare state might result from the
  	government lack of ability to commit not to help unlucky agents.
  	Incentive considerations that are crucial in standard insurance in
  	the presence of moral hazard play no role in this case. A benevolent
  	government that sets transfers after agents have chosen their effort
  	faces a pure risk-sharing problem and provides full insurance,
  	inducing too little effort. The lack of commitment ability might
  	also cause an indeterminancy: the economy might end in any of
  	several equilibria, without the government being able to push it to
  	a particular one.

Abstract: This paper extends the existing literature on linear quadratic
  	adjustment cost (LQAC) models under rational expectations to the
  	inferential issues arising when: (i) agents optimise with respect to
  	a vector of endogenous variables; (ii) the behavioural equations
  	stemming from the agent's optimisation problem are specified as
  	'exact' rational expectations models; (iii) the stochastic processes
  	involved are integrated of order one. We discuss estimation both in
  	a 'limited-information' and in a 'full-information' framework. In
  	the first case we show that consistent estimation of the structural
  	parameters may be achieved by focusing on the open-form solution to
  	the model, and implementing existing procedures. In the second case,
  	by focusing on the unique and stable forward-looking solution to the
  	model, we propose a likelihood-based inferential procedure in time

  	a cointegrated vector autoregression (CVAR) system representing the
  	joint data generation process for both the endogenous and exogenous
  	variables.

Title: Long Run Effects of Employment and Payroll Taxes in an Efficiency

Abstract: In equilibrium models of unemployment, e.g. efficiency wage
  	models, the level of unemployment generally depends on the level of
  	taxes on labor (see. e.g. Johnson and Layard (1986) and Pisauro
  	(1991)). Considering labor taxes levied on firms, the tax
  	authorities may choose between employment and payroll taxes where
  	the former is a head tax on the number of employees while the latter
  	is a tax on the cost of labor to firms. Pisauro (1991) has shown in
  	a short run efficiency wage model that the incidence of employment
  	and payroll taxes generally differ and, in particular, that
  	employment taxes lead to less wage restraint than payroll taxes.
  	Extending his model to the long run by allowing for free entry and
  	exit of firms we go one step further and consider whether changes in
  	the composition of labor taxes, balancing the government budget,
  	affect equilibrium unemployment in the long run. Our results reveat
  	that, perhaps somewhat surprisingly given the result that payroll
  	taxes lead to  more wage restraint than employment taxes, that more
  	extensive use of employment taxes instead of payroll taxes,
  	balancing the government budget, increases the level of employment
  	and decreases unemployment.

Title: International Tax Competition, Tax Cooperation and Capital Controls

Abstract: Tax competition between independent authorities is known to lead
  	to inefficient outcomes, implying there is scope for cooperation. In
  	and international framework where the authorities are national
  	governments, the undesirable features of tax competition may
  	alternatively be mitigated by imposing restrictions on international
  	capital flows. Using a two-country model it is shown that capital
  	controls may fully remedy the adverse effects of tax competition and
  	thereby render tax cooperation superfluous. In more general cases,
  	however, capital controls have some undesirable side-effects,
  	leaving room for cooperative actions. Moreover, the mere option of
  	imposing capital controls may promote the implementation of tax
  	cooperation.

Title: Multiple Equilibria in the Welfare State with Costly Policies.
Author-Name: Forteza, A
Keywords: WELFARE ECONOMICS ; INFORMATION ; GOVERNMENT ; FISCAL POLICY ; CAPITALISM
Length: 21 pages
Abstract: Benevolent governments lacking commitment ability might provide too much insurance. Private agents might free ride on the government concern and exert too little effort. The cost of implementing the redistributive policy may work as a commitment device, alleviating the credibility problem.

Keywords: UNCERTAINTY ; ECONOMETRICS ; PRICES ; INFLATION
Length: 39 pages
Abstract: The incentive to call for contract renewal to adjust prices is considered from a bilateral perspective in a setting changes in outside opportunities drive the incentive to renew contracts and costs preclude continuous renewal. A model encompassing several contract forms is formulated, and the existence of an equilibrium to the bilateral renewal game is established.

Title: Do Trade Unions Actually Worsen Economic Performance?
Author-Name: Sorensen, J-R
Keywords: TRADE UNIONS
Length: 23 pages
Abstract: The answer to the question in the title of course depends on how we define economic performance. In an overlapping generations model we show that trade unions do worsen economic performance in the sense that we get unemployment, but it is quite likely that trade unions give rise to a higher growth rate than what would have been the case if the labour market were competitive.

Keywords: ECONOMETRICS ; STATISTICS
Length: 79 pages
Abstract: This paper provides a survey of the recent literature dealing with 1(2) variables in economic time series, that is, processes that require to be differenced twice in order to become stationary. With reference to particular models intuition is provided of why 1(2) and polynomial cointegration are features likely to occur in economics.
