Abstract: A segregation of the labour market into a family-friendly and a non-family friendly sector
has the effect that women self-select into the sectors depending on institutional constraints,
preferences for family-friendly working conditions and expected wage differences. We find
that neglecting the sector dimension tends to understate the effect of birth-related
interruptions in both sectors. The combined effect of a large depreciation effect and no
recovery means that females in the non-family friendly sector (e.g. private sector) are
punished severely after childbirth. In the family friendly sector (e.g. public sector), we find
complete catching up.

Abstract: Policy mix problems may arise in a monetary union with centralized monetary policy and
decentralized fiscal policy. A consequence of this may be an inappropriate stabilization of
shocks. This paper addresses how policy coordination problems are affected by the objectives
of the monetary authority. It is shown that non-coordinated fiscal policies tend to be too
counter-cyclical in the case of aggregate shocks, and that this bias can be reduced by lowering
the weight to output stability in monetary policy. Oppositely, for country-specific shocks non-
oordinated fiscal policies tend to be too pro-cyclical and this bias can be reduced by
increasing the weight to output stability in monetary policy. Considering the assignment of
policy tasks -- within the set of binding policy rules for fiscal- and monetary policy -- it is
found that flexible inflation targeting dominates strict inflation targeting.

Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between fertility and divorce. The potential
endogeneity of fertility in divorce decisions is explicitly addressed by modelling fertility and
divorce jointly. We apply the "timing-of-event" method (Abbring & van den Berg (2002)) to
identify the causal effect of births on the divorce hazard. We show that couples who are less
prone to divorce are more prone to invest in children, and therefore one might (mistakenly)
conclude that children tend to stabilize marriages. However, when correcting for endogeneity
of fertility, we conclude that children themselves do not have a positive effect on marriage
duration.

Abstract: On many online auction sites it is now possible for a seller to augment his auction with a
maximum or buy-out price. The use of this instrument has been justified in "one-shot"
auctions by appeal to impatience or risk aversion. Here we offer additional justification by
observing that trading on Internet auctions is not of a "one-shot" nature, but that market
participants expect more transactions in the future. This has important implications when
bidders desire multiple objects. Specifically, it is shown that an early seller has an incentive
to introduce a buy-out price, if similar products are offered later on by other sellers. The buy-
ut price will increase revenue in the current auction, but revenue in future auctions will
decrease, as will the sum of revenues. In contrast, if a single seller owns multiple units,
overall revenue will increase, if buyers anticipate the use of buy-out prices in the future by
this seller. In both cases, an optimally chosen buy-out price introduces potential inefficiencies
in the allocation.

Abstract: This paper shows that the existence and persistence of  `overeducation' can be explained by a
simple extension of the efficiency wage model. When calibrated to fit the amounts of
overeducation found in most empirical studies, the model implies that both the relative wage
and the relative employment rate of high-skill workers will depend inversely on the aggregate
level of activity. The model may help explain the patterns of rising wage inequality that have
been observed in many countries since the early 1970s.

Abstract: This paper analyses the influence of norms of fairness on wage formation. Fairness is defined
by `real-wage' and `relative-wage' norms that relate wage offers to workers' own current wage
and to the wages of other groups of workers, and, to avoid shirking, firms pay fair wages. The
wage norms change endogenously, and the result is hysteresis with respect to both
employment and the distribution of wages. An extension of the model that allows `induced
overeducation' may help explain trends in wage inequality.

Abstract: The aims of this paper are, firstly, to estimate the Italian shadow economy by means of a
structural equation approach and, secondly, to verify the generality of the main criticisms
about the reliability of the "MIMIC method" (or model approach) for this kind of analysis.
Using the Italian shadow economy, I will show how only some of these are confirmed, others
exist as a consequence of the model implementation and sample and some more will exposed
to question this methodology. Particular attention is paid to detect the assumptions that
should be respected to use appropriately this technique (test of multinormality, independence
between measurement and structural errors, unit root detection, etc.). According to the
obtained results, is confirmed a sufficient reliability of this approach for the estimate of the
size of underground economy.

Abstract: This paper reviews a number of modern as well as classical econometric techniques suitable
for empirically determining whether commodities in physically separated markets belong to
the same geographical market. Even though the tools presented generalize to the delineation
of the relevant product market our main focus is on the geographical delineation of markets.
The analyses rely entirely on the use of price data of different types in an attempt to
operationalize the so-called SSNIP methodology for price comparisons. In particular, the
stationarity versus non-stationarity of price data appears important because otherwise
spurious results can potentially occur. Both bivariate and multivariate price comparisons will
be discussed. We also consider situations with data observations covering a relatively long
period and where it is likely that structural changes have occurred in the sample period
whereby the degree of market integration is likely to have changed. New techniques to deal
with such recursive features will be suggested. For the methods presented a discussion of the
practical problems and concerns facing the model builder are addressed.

Abstract: The paper presents a comparative study on the performance of commonly used estimators of
the fractional order of integration when data is contaminated by noise. In particular,
measurement errors, additive outliers, temporary change outliers, and structural change
outliers are addressed. It occurs that when the sample size is not too large, as is frequently the
case for macroeconomic data, then non-persistent noise will generally bias the estimators of
the memory parameter downwards. On the other hand, relatively more persistent noise like
temporary change outliers and structural changes can have the opposite effect and thus bias
the fractional parameter upwards. Surprisingly, with respect to the relative performance of the
various estimators, the parametric conditional maximum likelihood estimator with modelling
of the short run dynamics clearly outperforms the semiparametric estimators in the presence
of noise that is not too persistent.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate whether rent control affects the functioning of the labour market.
Particularly, we focus on the effect of rent control on the length of individual unemployment
duration. Theoretically, the effect is ambigious. Rent control reduces housing mobility and
could very well spill-over to mobility in the labour market. On the other hand to maintain
their rent control benefits unemployed individuals are presumably less demanding when
accepting a job in the local labour market. Based on a rich Danish data set we investigate the
empirical contents of the issue, and find results that are in clear accordance with the
theoretical predictions.

Abstract: This paper analyses the implications of real wage rigidities in a stochastic two-country
general equilibrium model. It is shown how real wage rigidities in one country affect welfare
in both countries. Assuming that the choice of whether or not to adopt flexible wages is in the
hands of labour unions within each country, it is found that wages will be flexible in either
no, one or both countries. Hence, even in this symmetric model flexible wages in one country
and rigid wages in the other may be an equilibrium. Since there are international spillover
effects of the choice of wage setting regime, the utilitarian solution is also considered.
Interestingly, this does not necessarily entail more real wage flexibility than in the Nash
equilibrium.

Abstract: Based on unique register data of male immigrants in Denmark, we investigate whether self-
employment is used as a last resort. To identify self-employment as a last resort, we define
different types of immigrants as a function of transition probabilities between wage-employment,
non-employment and self-employment. The transition probabilities are estimated using discrete
competing risks models controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and duration dependence. We
find that for certain groups of immigrants, a large fraction can be characterized as using self-
employment as a last resort.

Abstract: Public regulations can increase economic growth by correcting market faults and decrease
growth by consuming resources and reducing incentives. A simple theoretical framework is
developed to represent commonly held views on the relationship between growth an
regulation. The relationship is possibly non-linear with some level of regulation being
optimal. We estimate the relation by a fixed effect non-linear panel data regression model
using a new semi-parametric estimator. The outcome shows that the relationship indeed may
be non-linear: High levels of regulation lowers growth, but there is no effect on growth for
moderate to low levels of regulation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of home-ownership on labour mobility and unemployment
duration. We distinguish between finding employment locally or by being geographically
mobile. We find that home ownership hampers the propensity to move for job reasons but
improves the chances of finding local jobs, which is in accordance with the predictions from
our theoretical model. The overall hazard rate into employment is higher for home owners,
such that there is a negative correlation between home-ownership and unemployment
duration. Our empirical findings thus lend some support for the main mechanism behind the
so-called Oswald hypothesis, even if it does not find positive correlation between
unemployment duration and home ownership at the individual level.

Abstract: The recent literature on the aid-growth relation discusses two competing models: The Good
Policy Model, where the key feature is policy times aid, and the Medicine Model, where the key
feature is aid squared. Both have been reached on a sample of about 1/3 of the available data. We
present a base model, to replicate both models on that data set. It is then replicated on as much
of the available data as possible. Within the sample the Good Policy Model proves fragile, while
the Medicine Model is more robust. Neither model replicates outside the original data sample.
Further, we apply a semi-parametric regression technique to test for an unknown functional form
of the aid-growth relation. It rejects that aid is statistically significant. Thus the evidence in favor
of an aid-growth relationship - let alone a nonlinear one - is weak.

Abstract: The NPV of the income flows associated with an LDC outward migration are calculated for both
the immigrant from the LDC and for the host country DC in three different stylized cases: A
guest worker society of the Dubai type, an immigrant society of the US type, and a tax-based
welfare state with institutions of the Danish type. In the Dubai type case it appears that mutually
beneficial decisions can be made, and the same applies to a degree in the US type case. However,
in the Danish type evolved welfare case, immigration is an advantage for the immigrant,
especially one with less marketable skills and a disadvantage for the natives. This poses an
additional threat to the continuation of the traditional type of welfare state.
