We establish stylised facts for Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on longitudinal firm-level data from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistic covering, on average, 55,000 firms per year from 1971 to 1998, we analyse the reallocation across individual producers and its connection to aggregate business cycles. Our results indicate a pronounced heterogeneity across firms. Moreover, the distribution of growth rates of firm's real sales is influenced by business cycle conditions. The cross-section skewness of real sales changes is counter-cyclical. The results confirm findings for the UK and the US and are, therefore, robust stylised facts of the business cycle.
