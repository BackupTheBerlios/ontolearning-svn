Abstract: This paper presents evidence on how mortality in Denmark is related to different
socio-economic indicators. By use of unique and extensive sample of the Danish
population, we examine how mortality is related to factors such as education, occupation,
skill level and income for the years 1992-97. We employ a competing risks proportional
hazard model to allow for different causes of death. This turns out to be of importance as 
some factors have unequal (and sometimes opposite) influence on the cause-specific
mortality rates. Particularly, we find that the often found inverse correlation between
socio-economic status and mortality to a large degree is absent for women that die due to
cancer.

Abstract: This paper extends the work of Ray and Vohra (1997). It ascertains which
partitions of players will emerge and what actions will these players choose under each
partition, when they can sign binding agreements and their actions have externalities. The
emphasis, however, is placed on situations with multiple outcomes and how agents
behave in the presence of such multiplicity. In particular, a deviating coalition considers
all the likely outcomes that may prevail upon its deviation, and selects (if possible) a
subset of them, avoiding thus an excessively confident behavior, which is the case under Ray and
Vohra's notion. Three augmentations of their solution concept are defined, capturing three
distinct behavioral assumptions. Their efficiency and relation to each other are discussed.

Abstract: Coordination of tax policies among policy makers is an often considered remedy
against inefficiently low taxes on mobile tax bases induced by tax competition. Tax
coordination may, however, not be particularly successful if some countries do not take
part in the coordination. The outcome of such "partial coordination" in capital income
taxation is derived within a linear-quadratic tax competition model with imperfect capital
mobility, and the results suggest that the critical mass of countries needed for partial
coordination to matter significantly is likely to be a very large percentage of the
economies of the world, with the main benefits accruing to countries not participating.
This may call for implementation of a global capital income tax treaty administered along
the lines of the WTO trade agreements.

Title: Semiparametric Analysis of Stationary Fractional Cointegration and the

Abstract: We consider semiparametric frequency domain analysis of cointegration
between long memory processes, i.e. fractional cointegration. This concept allows
derivation of useful long-run relations even among stationary long memory processes. The
approach uses a degenerating part of the periodogram near the origin to form a frequency
domain least squares (FDLS) estimator of the cointegrating relation. The resulting
estimator is consistent for arbitrary short-run dynamics, whereas the latter would have to
be specified correctly in any parametric approach. We derive the asymptotic distribution
theory for the FDLS estimator of the cointegration vector in the stationary long memory
case. The new theory requires a general theorem on the asymptotic order of the covariance
between the cross-periodograms of stationary long memory processes, which we provide.
The motivating example is the relation between the volatility realized in the stock market
and the associated implicit volatility derived from option prices. An application to
high-frequency U.S. stock index and option data is offered.

Abstract: Progressive income taxation has for some time been recognized to provide
incentives for wage restraint in models with imperfectly competitive labour markets.
Recent research has established that bargaining over individual working hours may
reverse the wage restraining effect such that increased tax progression may reduce
employment. In the present paper an alternative explanation for such adverse employment
effects is suggested. Using an efficiency wage model it is shown that long-run adjustment
in the number of firms to changes in profits may imply that an increase in tax progression
has adverse employment effects when all the budgetary effects of the tax reform are taken
into account.

Abstract: The present paper tests for the existence of multicointegration between real
per capita private consumption expenditure and real per capita disposable
personal income in the USA. In doing so, we exploit the fact that the flows
of disposable income and consumption expenditure on the one hand, and the
stock of consumers' wealth, which can be considered as cumulative past
discrepancies between the flows of income and expenditure, on the other
hand, can be thought of as a stock-flow model, in which multicointegration is
likely to occur. We apply recently developed I(2) techniques for
testing for multicointegrating relations and find supporting evidence
for the existence of multicointegration in this simple bivariate model.

Abstract: This paper investigates how rent control affects mobility on the Danish private
rental housing market. Based on a unique and extensive data set a measure of the degree
of
rent regulation of each housing unit is calculated, and this is coupled with socio-economic
characteristics and spells of tenancy duration for each household. To accommodate the
special features of such a data set we apply a proportional hazard duration model, that
encompasses both the presence of left truncated tenancy durations, right censored
observations and allows for a very flexible specification of the time dependency as
captured
by the baseline hazard function. We find that tenancy mobility is severely reduced by the
presence of rent control. Tenancy duration for a typical household in the private rental
sector
is found to be more than six years longer if the apartment belongs to the 10 per cent most
regulated units than if it belongs to the 10 per cent least regulated units.

Abstract: Recent literature shows that embedding fractionally integrated time series
models
with spectral poles at the long-run and/or seasonal frequencies in autoregressive
frameworks
leads to estimators and test statistics with non-standard limiting distributions that must be
simulated on a case-by-case basis. However, we show that by embedding the models in
a
general I(d) framework the resulting estimators and tests regain all the desirable properties
from standard statistical analysis. We derive the time domain maximum likelihood
estimator
and show that it is consistent, asymptotically normal, and under Gaussianity
asymptotically
efficient in the sense that it has asymptotic variance equal to the inverse of the Fisher
information matrix. The three likelihood based test statistics (Wald, likelihood ratio, and
Lagrange multiplier) are asymptotically equivalent and have the usual asymptotic
chi-squared distribution and under the additional assumption of Gaussianity they are
locally
most powerful. In the special case where the dynamics of the model is characterized by
a
scalar parameter, we show that, in addition, the two-sided tests achieve the Gaussian
power
envelope of all invariant and unbiased tests, i.e. they are uniformly most powerful
invariant
unbiased. The finite sample properties of the tests are evaluated by Monte Carlo
experiments. In contrast to what might be expected from the literature, the likelihood ratio
test is found to outperform the Lagrange multiplier and Wald tests.

Abstract:This paper analyzes cartel stability when firms are farsighted. It studies a price
leadership model a la D' Aspremont et al. (1983), where the dominant cartel acts as a
leader
by determining the market price, while the fringe behaves competitively. According to D'
Aspremont et al.'s (1983) approach a cartel is stable if no firm has an incentive to either
enter or exit the cartel. In deciding whether to deviate or not, a firm compares its status
quo
with the outcome its unilateral deviation induces. However, the firm fails to examine
whether the induced outcome will indeed become the new status quo that will determine
its
profits. Although the firm anticipates the price adjustment following its deviation, it
ignores
the possibility that more firms may exit (or enter) the cartel that may eventually stabilize
in a
very different situation from the one the firm riginally induced. In other words, the firm
does
not consider the fact that the outcome immediately induced by its deviation may not be
stable itself. We propose a notion of cartel stability that allows firms to fully foresee the
result of their deviation. Our solution concept is built in the spirit of von Neumann and
Morgenstern's (1944) stable set, while it modifies the dominance relation following
Harsanyi's (1974) criticism.We show that there always exists a unique, non-empty set of
stable cartels and provide an algorithm the determines it.

Abstract:
In this paper we examine the formation of International Environmental  Agreement
(IEAs). We provide an analytical treatment of the main model used in the literature and
offer a formal solution of it (which has not been available so far), while we clarify some
misconceptions that exist in the literature. We find that the unique stable IEA consist of
either two, three or four signatories if the number of countries is greater than or equal to
5. Furthermore, we show that the welfare of the signatories of a stable IEA is very close
to its lowest level vs the welfare of signatories of other non-stable IEAs. While in our
model countries' choice variable is emissions, we extend our results to the case where the
choice variable is abatement efforts.
