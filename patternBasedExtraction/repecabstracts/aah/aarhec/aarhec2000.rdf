Abstract: We examine some of the consequences on commonly used unit root tests when
the underlying series is integrated of order two. It turns out that standard augmented
Dickey-Fuller type of tests for a single unit root have excessive density in the explosive
region of the distribution. The lower (stationary) tail, however, will be virtually unaffected
in the presence of double unit roots. On the other hand, the Phillips-Perron test is shown
to diverge to plus infinity asymptotically and thus will favor the explosive alternative.
Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the analytical results and some of the
implications in finite samples.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize three commonly used double unit
root tests in terms of their asymptotic local power. To this end, we study a class of nearly
doubly integrated processes which in the limit will behave as a weighted integral of a
double indexed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Based on a numerical examination of the
analytical distributions, a comparison of the tests is made via their asymptotic local power
functions.

Abstract: This paper applies quasi-static analysis to a simple closed macroeconomy. It is
shown that if the economy satisfies a conservation of income requirement, and the
requirement that all equivalent investments generate the same rate of return (non-
arbitrage), then there exists a state variable which measures the opportunity cost of
moving from one macroeconomic equilibrium to another. This state variable is an
economic constraint which measures the expenditure necessary to change equilibria.
Central to this analysis is a definition of economic time, which is an invariant quantity
with respect to the state variables used as a frame of reference.

Abstract: Ben-Porath (1997) characterizes the strategies consistent with common certainty
of rationality (CCR) and the origin of a generic game of perfect information. More
generally, the notion of "weak extensive form rationalizability" (weak EFR) captures the
implications initial CCR in an extensive form game. We go one step further by
ascertaining at which additional information sets initial CCR can be maintained
"consistently". Our consistency notion has two aspects: we examine whether there is
"internal consistency" in assuming CCR at a given collection of information sets by using
Battigalli and Siniscalchi's (1999) recent result while we introduce "external consistency"
to account for all reachable information sets. For a class of games, including all belief-
consistent games [cf. Reny (1993)], we identify a unique collection of information sets
and hence a unique set of strategy profiles; moreover, we show that in this case our notion
is outcome-equivalent to Pearce's (1984) EFR. But in general out notion is between weak
and Pearce's EFR.

Abstract: Ever since the adoption of the symbiosis of mathematical analytical methods and
marginalism in economics, there has been a tendency of negligence in the sense that it is
seldom to ask the dual question: what are the fundamental assumptions on which the
above approach is resting and are they worth while as measured by realia? In a rather
informal form we try to address some aspects of these basic questions. A main result is
that it is very doubtful to rely too naively on main stream results, relying on a one-
dimensional concept of homogenous labour. Most of the standard results on this
foundation - including those of unemployment - are ambiguous, at best.

Abstract: We derive the family of tests for a unit root with maximal power against a point
alternative when an arbitrary number of stationary covariates are modeled with the
potentially integrated series. We show that very large power gains are available when such
covariates are available. We then derive tests which are simple to construct (involving the
running of vector autoregressions) and achieve at a point the power envelopes derived
under very general conditions. These tests have excellent properties in small samples. We
also show that these are obvious and internally consistent tests to run when identifying
structural VAR's using long run restrictions.

Title: A Dynamic Agricultural Household Model with Uncertain Income and Irreversible

Abstract: A dynamic model of agricultural household behaviour in less developed
countries in the presence of credit constraints and income uncertainty is developed. The
production side of the model takes into account the irreversible and indivisible nature of
non-stationary agricultural investment options, thereby combining the standard intertem-
poral consumption model with features from the real option pricing literature. The model
framework represents an interesting dynamic alternative to the static household models
in the literature. It is shown that the model can be solved by use of dynamic programming
routines, and numerical results are obtained for a variety of parameter values. Several
interesting results emerge: First, the consumption policy functions of the agricultural
household can become highly non-linear, violating the standard result that increased
wealth implies increased consumption. This has implications for empirical estimation.
Secondly, increasing uncertainty does not in general reduce the average propensity to
consume, or increase the propensity to save. Thirdly, increased variation of income only
to a limited extent carries through to variation in consumption. Fourthly, the effects of
shocks to income depend crucially on the timing of shocks. And finally, reducing
uncertainty does not reduce poverty significantly, whereas agricultural extension services
and cash transfers are more likely to do so.

Abstract: Frequently, seasonal and non-seasonal data (especially macro time series) are
observed with noise. For instance, the time series can have irregular abrupt changes and
interruptions following as a result of additive or temporary change outliers caused by
external circumstances which are irrelevant for the series of interest. Equally, the time
series can have measurement errors. In this paper we analyse the above types of data
irregularities on the behaviour of seasonal unit root tests. It occurs that in most cases
outliers and measurement errors can seriously affect inference towards the rejection of
seasonal unit roots. It is shown how the distortion of the tests will depend upon the
frequency, magnitude, and persistence of the outliers as well as on the signal to noise ratio
associated with measurement errors. Some solutions to the implied inference problems are
suggested.

Abstract: The paper was originally written in Danish as part of a planned book which
found no publisher. Readers of the present abstract who cannot read Danish may find
some quotations given in English in the Danish text, so it may be useful to give references
to page numbers in that text in the present abstract. The aim of "A Criticism of the Theory
of General Equilibrium" has been to argue that the said Theory is no model of any actual
economic process. It simply states a number of mathematical assumptions sufficient to
construct a model of a logically possible perfect market, but these assumptions are not
only false as a description of actual economic systems, but as argued in the paper could
at most be realised in a very small economic system or market. The author has felt so
astonished by the views expressed in Joseph Schumpeter's "History of Economic
Analysis", and by the views of economic authors such as Paul Samuelson and Robert
Solow, and so convinced that they express a lack of real understanding of Keynesian
views on the part of these famous economists, that he found it worthwhile to exhibit these
weaknesses of so-called "neo-neo-classical economic theory" as strongly as possible.
Keynesianism is incompatible with neo-classical theory based on the economic model due
to Léon Walras. To demonstrate the truth of this statement the growth models by Roy
Harrod representing the Keynesian and by Robert Solow representing the neo-classical
point of view are compared and shown to be based on radically different assumptions.
Also the IS-LM-model by John Hicks, as supported by Alvin Hansen, is shown to be un-
Keynesian. In connection with these issues an attempt is made to replace the concept of
equilibrium as defined by temporal stationarity by a concept of logical determination. The 
title of the text in Danish translates as already mentioned as "A Criticism of the General
Equilibrium Model". The logic of this model is sketched on the first page as a distribution
of provisions procured by the "breadwinners" of some primitive tribe. Such a distribution
may be described by a model mathematically similar to that used by Baumol and Oates
in their "The Theory of Environmental Policy" (1975, 1988). But it is irrelevant in the
context of actual modern markets, i.e. to Economic Policy. L‚on Walras is usually
regarded as the original author of this model in its present form. The enthusiastic
evaluation by Schumpeter of this model in his "History of Economic Analysis"
(posthumous edition 1954) is illustrated by the quotations on pages 42-43 of the Danish
text. I claim that Schumpeter's evaluation is misleading. On pages 44 et seq. the
assessment of Keynesianism by Schumpeter in 1936 based on his review of Keynes's
"General Theory" is described and also analysed as the expression of a lack of
understanding. The positive evaluation of the Keynesian views by the present author has
also been the inspiration of his criticism of American economists such as Paul Samuelson
and Robert Solow. On pages 55-62 it is shown that Robert Solow's criticism of Roy
Harrod's growth model is due to a completely mistaken view of the aim of that model. On
pages 66-71 a similar criticism is given of John Hick's ISLM-model and Alvin Hansen's
defence of this model in his "A Guide (sic!) to Keynes". It would be very na‹ve to deny
that the use in practice of "the Keynesian recipe" in order to solve the problem of "full
employment" (in itself a loose concept) is difficult, but Milton Friedman's criticism of
"the Phillips Curve" (which is not Keynesian) does not hit the mark, as I think is shown
by my arguments on pages 89-94. "Involuntary unemployment" is a real phenomenon, and
Friedman's claim that unemployed workers will not seek employment, unless current
wages are increased, goes against a fundamental Keynesian assumption. This assumption
is based on an institutional fact. But economic assumptions must be based on institutional
facts in order to be relevant in the real world. Economic problems are not solved by
mathematics, but by the ability to diagnose shortcomings of economic systems and
rational measures to abolish them. To determine such measures should be the real aim of
economic science as it was to John Maynard Keynes. The concluding text of the paper on
pages 94-105 supports the present author's own views by references to books by Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen and a recent book by the German author Karl-Heinz Brodbeck.
Interested readers of this Abstract who cannot read Danish may also form some ideas of
the contents by perusal of the References concluding the Danish text since most of the
literature used is in English or German.

Abstract: The statute of the ECB states that its primary target should be to maintain price
stability. The theoretical foundation behind this target is that of a socially optimal
conservative central banker. We challenge the robustness of this result in a model with
endogenous labor market policy, decided upon by a politically motivated government. In
this model, the socially optimal choice of central banker is an ultra-liberal, who eliminates
both inflation and unemployment and removes the political distortion. Somewhat
paradoxically, the labor union supports an ultra-conservative central banker, because this
means a more generous labor market policy.

Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2000)], where individuals' preferences depend solely on the
composition of the coalition they belong to. We show that the four solution concepts
studied in the literature (core, Nash stability, individual stability and contractual individual
stability) exhibit myopia on the part of the players. We amend these notions by endowing
players with foresight in that they look many steps ahead and consider only credible
outcomes. We show the existence and study the properties of the new solutions, as well
as their relation to the previous notions.

Abstract: This paper studies infinitely repeated games where players can form coalitions
to coordinate their actions via self-enforcing agreements. The proposed notion of "stable
agreements" extends a characterization of the set of subgame perfect equilibrium paths
by Greenberg (1989, 1990) to account for self-enforcing coalitional deviations. An
agreement is stable if no coalition can deviate in such a way that by solely coordinating
the actions of its own members, it guarantees a higher payoff for each member. Existence
of the proposed notion is established and its relation to other notions is investigated.

Abstract: This paper considers optimal investment behaviour when investment options
evolve deterministically or stochastically over time and investments are irreversible and
indivisible. It extends the standard investment-under-uncertainty set-up with a single
investment option to the case of repeated options. Analytical solutions are derived for the
deterministic case and for the case of a geometric Brownian motion. It is argued that when
investment options are repeated, the simple net-present-value rule in general fares better
as an investment criterion than the rule derived from the single-option approach.
Furthermore, sensitivity analyses reveal that the effects of parameter changes are very
different when using the repeated-options approach instead of the single-option approach.

AutoRegressive (BSTAR) model is that it allows for different speed of transition between
the middle regime and each of the identical outer regimes. Thus, the BSTAR model can
be considered as a generalization of the LSTR2 model introduced in Ter„svirta (1998)
which imposes symmetric speed of adjustment between the middle and each of the
identical outer regimes.

Abstract: Using a simple model with two levels of skill, we assume that high-skill workers
who fail to get high-skill jobs may accept low-skill positions; low-skill workers do not
have the analogous option of filling high-skill positions. This asymmetry implies that a
slowdown in Hicks-neutral technical change (or other adverse, skill-neutral shocks) may
cause an increase in wage inequality, both between and within skill categories, as well as
an increase in unemployment, especially among low-skill workers. Movements in
productivity, unemployment and inequality may thus be linked to induced overeducation
and credentialism.

Abstract: Inflation may enhance the efficiency of the price system in the presence of
nominal rigidities. For the price system to function efficiently there is a need for nominal
prices to adjust both to real and nominal shocks for relative prices to disseminate the
appropriate signals. Since the incentive for price setters to change prices depends not only
on the costs of changing prices but also on the realized shocks, it follows that the rate of
inflation may affect the incentive to change prices. The higher the rate of inflation the
larger the incentive to change prices, and in the presence of real shocks requiring
adjustment of relative prices this may lead to a better functioning price system. Empirical
evidence supports that nominal rigidities are more prevalent at low rates of inflation. It
follows that there cen be welfare costs of targeting inflation at too low a level.
