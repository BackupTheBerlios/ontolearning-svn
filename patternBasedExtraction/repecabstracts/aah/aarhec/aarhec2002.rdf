Abstract: In this paper, we perform an extensive Monte Carlo study of the finite sample
properties of different estimators for panel data sample selection models. The estimators 
investigated are various two-step estimators and maximum likelihood estimators with
simultaneous equations for the sampleselection process and the equation of interest. The
main result of the MonteCarlo study is that the maximum likelihood estimators of random
effectsmodels in general perform better than the two-step estimators.

Abstract:This paper discusses how international integration affects the need and scope for
welfare state activities. The first part reviews the main mechanisms, which have been
considered in the literature, namely, tax base mobility, risk and race to the bottom effects
in welfare policies. The second part considers in more detail the implications that arise via
labour market effects, and it is argued that the latter are crucial since product market
integration affects the mobility of jobs, even though labour mobility across nations
remains small. This may in turn have important consequences for the financing of welfare
state activities through taxes levied on labour, but also the need for welfare state activities.
The paper ends by discussing some policy options.

Abstract: The choice of exchange rate regime is considered for a small open economy. Assuming
that different forms of fixed exchange rate regimes involve different costs of reneging, it
is shown that one potential beneficial aspect of joining a monetary union with a common
currency is that it is less likely to be exposed to ''speculative attacks'' than less formalized
fixed exchange rate arrangements.

Abstract: Does it matter for the propagation mechanism following nominal shocks whether nominal
rigidities are specified as sticky wages instead of sticky prices? We analyze the question in a
standard dynamic general equilibrium "new open macro-economy" model, which is solved
analytically. By comparing the adjustment patterns of the terms of trade, in an otherwise
unchanged model under, respectively, nominal wage and price rigidities, we find that the two
types of rigidities give rise to the same persistence pattern. Specifically, nominal wage and
price rigidities are equivalent "impact adjusted" propagation mechanisms. Results are
presented for one-period nominal rigidities and two-period nominal staggering.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how to best exploit the information contained in spells that are
in progress when an observation period begins, that is, left-censored and left-truncated
duration data. We provide a survey of censoring and truncation mechanisms in event
history models. We describe some approaches that have been suggested in the literature
to deal with left-censoring. Our contribution is the description of ways to use additional
information to obtain more efficient parameter estimates using the left-censored
informations, and particularly, the derivation of the associated likelihood expressions. In
order to use the information efficiently, we often resort to the stationarity assumption.
Hence, we provide a Hausman test for this assumption. The second part of the paper
briefly presents some empirical examples which demonstrates the efficiency gains
associated with the use of the information contained in the left-censored observations. In
particular, we show how the use of some additional pieces of information allows us to
obtain more efficient estimates of the parameters of interest. In doing this, we use the
information reported in the waves 1990-1992 of the French Labour Force Surveys on young French individuals.

Abstract: We consider statistical inference for multivariate fractionally integrated time series models using
a computationally simple conditional likelihood procedure which has recently been shown to be
efficient in the univariate case. We show that those results generalize to the present multivariate
setup, e.g. allowing us to efficiently estimate the memory parameters of vector ARFIMA models
or test if two or more series are integrated of the same possibly fractional order. In particular, we
show that all the desirable properties from standard statistical analysis apply for the time domain
maximum likelihood estimator and related test statistics, i.e. consistency, standard asymptotic
distributional properties, and under Gaussianity asymptotic efficiency. The finite sample
properties of the likelihood ratio test are evaluated by Monte Carlo experiments, which show that
rejection frequencies are very close to the asymptotic local power for samples as small as n=100.

Abstract:We propose a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of the null hypothesis of cointegration in
fractionally cointegrated models. The test statistic utilizes fully modified residuals to cancel the
endogeneity and serial correlation biases, and we show that standard asymptotics apply. With
i.i.d. Gaussian errors the asymptotic Gaussian power envelope of all invariant (invariant and
unbiased) tests is achieved by the one-sided (two-sided) test. The finite sample properties are
illustrated by a Monte Carlo study. In an application to the dynamics among exchange rates for
seven major currencies against the US dollar some evidence of the existence of a cointegrating
relation is found.

Abstract:We consider a local Whittle analysis of a stationary fractionally cointegrated model. A two step
estimator equivalent to the local Whittle QMLE is proposed to jointly estimate the integration
orders of the regressors, the integration order of the errors, and the cointegration vector. The
estimator is semiparametric in the sense that it employs local assumptions on the joint spectral
density matrix of the regressors and the errors near the zero frequency. We show that, for the
entire stationary region of the integration orders, the estimator is asymptotically normal with
block diagonal covariance matrix. Thus, the estimates of the integration orders are asymptotically
independent of the estimate of the cointegration vector. Furthermore, our estimator of the
cointegrating vector is asymptotically normal for a wider range of integration orders than the
narrow band frequency domain least squares estimator and is superior with respect to asymptotic
variance. An application to financial volatility series is offered.

Abstract: If agents negotiate openly and form coalitions, can they reach efficient agreements?
We address this issue within a class of coalition formation games with externalities where
agents' preferences depend solely on the coalition structures they are associated with.
We derive Ray and Vohra's (1997) notion of equilibrium binding agreements using von Neumann
and Morgenstern abstract stable set and then extend it to allow for arbitrary coalitional
deviations (as opposed to nested deviations assumed originally). We show that, while the new
notion facilitates the attainment of efficient agreements, inefficient agreements can nevertheless
arise

Abstract: We examine the formation of International Environmental Agreements (IEAs). We extend
the existing literature by endogenizing the reaction of the IEA's members to a deviation
by a member or a group of members. We assume that when a country contemplates exiting
or joining an agreement, it takes into account the reactions of other countries ignited by
its own actions. We identify conditions under which there always exists a unique set of
farsighted stable IEAs. The new farsighted IEAs can be much larger than those some of
the previous models supported but are not always Pareto efficient. We extend the analysis
to allow for coordinated action, that is, groups of countries jointly exiting or entering the
agreement and fully characterize the coalitionally farsighted stable IEAs.

Abstract: 
Cointegration imposes restrictions on the frequency domain behavior of a time series at the
zero-frequency. We derive these restrictions for a multivariate fractionally cointegrated system.
In particular, we consider a p-vector time series integrated of order d with r cointegrating
relations, given by the rows of [I_{r};ß'], where the cointegration errors are integrated of order
d-b, d=b>0. We show that, at the zero-frequency, the spectral density matrix of the d'th
differenced series has reduced rank (p-r), the coherence and phase measures (multiple and
partial) equal unity and zero, respectively, and the gain is the matrix of cointegrating coefficients.
Extensions to noncontemporaneous cointegration, seasonal cointegration, and different fractional
values of b for each cointegrating relation are considered.

Abstract: 
This paper considers estimation of a dynamic discrete choice model with second order state
dependence in the presence of strictly exogenous time-varying explanatory variables. We propose 
new method for estimating such models, and a small Monte Carlo study suggests that the method 
erforms well in practice. The method is used to test for duration dependence in labour market spells 
for French youth. The novelty in the application is that we are able to control for time-varying 
explanatory variables. In a discrete time duration model, duration dependence will result in second 
order state dependence, and the paper therefore also adds to the literature on estimation of duration 
models with unobserved heterogeneity.

Abstract: 
In this paper we analyse the movements of French young people between three states:
employment, unemployment and non-participation, using data from the waves 1990-1992 of
the French Labour Survey. Some of these event histories are left-censored. We therefore
address the problem of  initial conditions by invoking a stationarity assumption in the 
statistical framework of multi-states multi-spells duration models. We subsequently construct
a Hausman test of the stationarity assumption We allow for interdependence between
duration variables and we use an adjusted likelihood ratio test in order to choose the best
distribution for unobservables. We are particularly interested in identifying characteristics
that are associated with less favourable event histories. The results show that higher
educational attainments are associated with shorter unemployment durations and with longer
durations when employed. Another important factor is nationality; indeed to be of French
nationality is often associated with better outcomes in the labour market.

Abstract: 
In this paper long-run forecasting of multicointegrating variables is investigated.
Multicointegration typically occurs in dynamic systems involving both stock and flow
variables whereby a common feature in the form of shared stochastic trends is present across
different levels of multiple time series. Hence, the effect of imposing this "common feature"
restriction on out-of-sample valuation and forecasting accuracy of such variables is of
interest. In particular, we compare the long-run forecasting performance of the
multicointegrated variables between a model that correctly imposes the "common feature"
restrictions and a (univariate) model that omits these multicointegrating restrictions
completely. We employ different loss functions based on a range of mean square forecast
error criteria, and the results indicate that different loss functions result in different ranking
of models with respect to their infinite horizon forecasting performance. We consider loss
functions using a standard trace mean square forecast error criterion (penalizing the forecast
errors of flow variables only), and a loss function evaluating forecast errors of changes in
both stock and flow variables. The latter loss function is based on the triangular
representation of cointegrated systems and was initially suggested by Christoffersen and
Diebold (1998). It penalizes deviations from long-run relations among the flow variables
through cointegrating restrictions. We present a new loss function which further penalizes
deviations in the long run relationship between the levels of stock and flow variables. It is
derived from the triangular representation of multicointegrated systems. Using this criterion,
system forecasts from a model incorporating multicointegration restrictions dominate
forecasts from univariate models. The paper highlights the importance of carefully selecting
loss functions in forecast evaluation of models involving stock and flow variables.

Abstract: 
We consider semiparametric estimation in time series regression in the presence of long range
dependence in both the errors and the stochastic regressors. A central limit theorem is
established for a class of semiparametric frequency domain weighted least squares estimates,
which includes both narrow band ordinary least squares and narrow band generalized least
squares as special cases. The estimates are semiparametric in the sense that focus is on the
neighborhood of the origin, and only periodogram ordinates in a degenerating band around
the origin are used. This setting differs from earlier work on time series regression with long
range dependence where a fully parametric approach has been employed. The generalized
least squares estimate is infeasible when the degree of long range dependence is unknown and
must be estimated in an initial step. In that case, we show that a feasible estimate exists,
which has the same asymptotic properties as the infeasible estimate. By Monte Carlo
simulation, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the generalized least squares
estimate and the feasible estimate.

Abstract: 
We introduce a multivariate Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test for fractional integration. We derive
and analyze the LM statistic and show that it is asymptotically chi-squared distributed under local
alternatives, and that, under Gaussianity, the LM test is asymptotically efficient against local
alternatives. It is shown that the regression variant in Breitung & Hassler (2002, Journal of
Econometrics 110, 167-185) is not equivalent to the LM test in the multivariate case, although it
is in the univariate case. A generalization of the LM test that explicitly allows for different
integration orders for each variate is also introduced. The finite sample properties of the LM test
are evaluated and compared to the Breitung & Hassler (2002) test by Monte Carlo experiments.
An application to multivariate time series of real interest rates for six countries is offered,
demonstrating that more clear-cut evidence can be drawn from multivariate tests compared to
conducting several univariate tests.
